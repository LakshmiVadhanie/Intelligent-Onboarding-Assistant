Im a Salesforce Release Engineer based in Austin, Texas with a background in Salesforce administration, process optimization, and change management. My work revolves around ensuring smooth deployments, maintaining system integrity, and continuously improving our release processes. Im also a three-time Certified Salesforce Administrator, so safe to say I love Salesforce.\nI thrive in problem-solving environments, where I can experiment, refine, and iterate to find the best solutions. I believe in balancing structure with adaptabilityhaving a solid process while staying flexible when new challenges arise.\nOutside of work, I enjoy running & cycling, spending time with my dog Rollei, and exploring creative side projects.\nMy GitLab Story\nMy journey with GitLab started when I transitioned into a Release Engineering role, bringing my experience as a Salesforce Administrator into a space where DevOps and process optimization intersect. Im passionate about building efficient, scalable processes and ensuring that teams can deploy changes with confidence.\nAs someone who enjoys continuous learning, Ive been deepening my knowledge of release management, DevOps methodologies, and CI/CD processes. Im particularly interested in streamlining deployments, enhancing automation, and driving consistency across environments.\nMy Working Style\nProactive over Reactive\n I believe in planning ahead to anticipate challenges and mitigate risks before they become issues. The more we plan, the better the outcome and the lower the risk.\nHands-On & Iterative\n I learn best by doing and refining as I go. I dont expect perfection on the first try, but I do aim for continuous improvement. I like to test solutions, gather feedback, and make adjustments based on what works best.\nStructured but Adaptable\n I appreciate clear frameworks and processes, but recognize that flexibility is essential for growth. If something isnt working, Im quick to pivot and adjust.\nBig-Picture Thinker with Attention to Detail\n I like understanding the why behind a process and how it fits into the larger system while ensuring the finer details are handled effectively.\nIndependent but Collaborative\n Im comfortable working autonomously and taking ownership of my projects, but also value collaboration, brainstorming, and knowledge-sharing.\nPrecision & Accuracy Over Vagueness\n I prefer clarity in communication and execution. I value precise details over broad generalizations to ensure alignment and efficiency. The more clear your directives, the better output you will receive from me.\nWork Smarter, Not Harder\n I prioritize efficiency and finding optimized solutions. If theres a way to streamline a process or reduce unnecessary complexity, Ill seek it out to improve workflows without sacrificing quality.\nCommunication Style\nDirect & Solution-Oriented\n I appreciate clear, concise communication that focuses on solutions. If something needs to be fixed, Id rather address it early and work toward a resolution.\nAsynchronous & Thoughtful\n I prefer async communication whenever possible, giving space for deep work and thoughtful responses. If something is urgent, I appreciate a ping to bring it to my attention.\nFeedback-Friendly\n I welcome feedback and see it as an opportunity for growth. If something can be improved, Id rather know sooner than later.\nContext Matters\n When discussing issues or decisions, I appreciate background information to understand the full picture. If I ask a lot of questions, its because I want to ensure alignment and clarity.\nCurrent Projects\nEvaluating a Salesforce-specific CI/CD solution to improve release efficiency and lower bug introductions.\nRelated Sites\nLinkedIn\nSalesforce Trailblazer Profile\nGitLab Profile\nLast modified February 20, 2025:\nAddition of Analissa Moreno README for EntApps Page (\nbbb60edb\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
