They drive customer satisfaction and adoption, deliver GTM efficiency, assist in channel development and ultimately, expand our revenue and improve our position in the market.\nAs the demands of the business grow in complexity and the areas that self-service touches increase, it will be crucial for us to align on one, common self-service strategy.\nThe goal of this group is to ultimately define the most effective way to deliver on self-service and bridge the gap between where we are today and our long-term vision and objectives.\nnote:\nZuora SSOT\nis a prerequisite of any system changes coming out of this working group. Following through on this work enables us to scale and iterate more efficiently, even if we were to recommend leveraging a COTS solution.\nPrerequisites\nweve identified some prerequisites that must be complete before pursuing a recommendation from this working group. These items have prevented significant progress thus far and will only make matters worse if not addressed prior to additional investment (either build or buy)\nPrerequisite\nRationale\nZuora SSOT\nZuora needs to be the SSOT for our Product Catalog, and what a customer has bought (subs, invoices, payments, etc)\nCustomer as a First Class Citizen\nAs of 2022-02 we map a user to a subscription, but a Zuora account maps to a customer. We need to resolve this before scaling to a new or improved system\nSSO\nAs of 2022-02 a customer can have two logins, their GitLab.com account AND an account on customers.gitlab.com, we need to merge these and maintain a single SSO system (gitlab.com account)\nAccount Management Access Controls & Billing Roles\nThe admin is not always the person at a customers organization who is responsible to manage the subscription. We need a solution that support billing roles, billing perms or perm sets (actual solution still TBD) that ensures the right person at a customers organization has access\nExit Criteria\nIdentification and prioritization of all prerequisites on appropriate team roadmaps (WG will not cover delivery/execution)\nRecommendation on how to deliver long-term objectives, including assessment on build vs buy.\nPropose and Open additional roles to execute on ecommerce integration work\nTimeline\nPath 1 (2022-02-02  2022-02-18) - 2 weeks\nDefined long-term / future-state of the self-service business needs across all teams and departments in a JTBD framework\ncollaborators input\ndoc\nKazem Kutob\nOmar Fernandez\nDefine current state of self-service capabilities\ndoc\nOmar Fernandez\nAlex Martin\nPath 2 (2022-02-18  2022-04-08) - 7 weeks\nTranslate wishlist into feature families and capabilities consumable by vendors and cover any other technical components\nBryan Wise and Mark Quitevis\nKazem Kutob\nJerome Ng\nReceive input from vendors (and CustomersDot) on capabilities\nBryan Wise and Mark Quitevis\nJerome Ng\nBuild high-level estimate of integrations requirements and timeline\nJerome Ng\nPath 3 (2022-04-08  2022-04-19) - 2 weeks\nRecommendation on how to deliver long-term objectives, including assessment on build vs buy.\nJustin Farris\nOut of Scope\nWe will not be performing a deep RFP and vendor assessment and selection as part of this exercise\nAligning on cross-functional values and operating principles to deliver on e-commerce is out of scope in this WG, but such work may follow in a different format in the next phase\nRoles and Responsibilities\nContributors\nDRIs held accountable to deliver on the exit criteria. Required to attend syncronous discussions and collaborate with reviewers to collect input and feedback. Similar to Responsible and Accountable in a RACI framework.\nCollaborators\nStakeholders with business requirements or domain expertise who will provide input to contributors. No need for regular or syncronus attendance, will engage async with contributors as appropriate. Similar to Consulted and Informed in a RACI framework.\nWorking Group Role\nPerson\nTitle\nExecutive Sponsor\nRyan ONell\nVP Commercial\nFacilitator\nKazem Kutob\nDirector, Online Sales & Self Service\nContributor\nJustin Farris\nSr Director, Product Monetization\nContributor\nAlex Martin\nSr Manager, Online Sales\nContributor\nBryan Wise\nVP, IT\nContributor\nJerome Z Ng\nSr Engineering Manager, Fulfillment\nContributor\nOmar Fernandez\nInterim Director of Product, Fulfillment\nContributor\nJerome Ng\nSr Engineering Manager, Fulfillment\nContributor\nMark Quitevis\nSr Business Systems Analyst\nCollaborator\nTatyana Golubeva\nPrincipal PM, Purchase\nCollaborator\nEmily Sybrant\nProduct Designer, Purchase\nCollaborator\nJames Lopez\nBackend Engineering Manager, Fulfillment:License\nCollaborator\nTyler Amos\nStaff Backend Engineer, Fulfillment:License\nCollaborator\nHila Qu\nDirector of Product, Growth\nCollaborator\nChristopher Nelson\nSr Director, Enterprise Applications\nCollaborator\nJessica Salcido\nFinance Systems Administrator\nCollaborator\nDaniel Parker\nSenior Integrations Engineer, Business Technology\nCollaborator\nSarah McCauley\nFinance\nCollaborator\nMichelle Hodges\nVP, Channel Sales\nCollaborator\nJack Brennan\nSr Director, Sales Systems\nCollaborator\nDavid Duncan\nVP Marketing\nCollaborator\nMichael Preuss\nDirector, Digital Experience\nCollaborator\nSindhu Tatimatla\nDirector, Analytics & Insights\nCollaborator\nCheri Holmes\nChief of Staff to CRO\nCollaborator\nJake Bielecki\nSr Director, Sales Strategy and Ops\nCollaborator\nShaun McCann\nDirector, Support Engineering\nCollaborator\nJesse Rabbits\nSr. Manager, Deal Desk\nLast modified May 14, 2024:\nUpdate markdownlint and fix biztech folder (\n190e30aa\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
