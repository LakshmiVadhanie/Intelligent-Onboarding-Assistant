  "content": "Security Operations On-Call Guide\nThe Security Operations sub-department is collectively responsible for responding to reports of actual or potential security incidents on a 24/7/365 basis.\nThe SIRT (Security Incident Response Team) generally responds to reports of suspicious activities (e.g. Phishing, hacking, social engineering) and security alerts.\nThe Trust & Safety team generally responds to reports of cryptomining, platform SPAM, abuse, bullying and violations of terms of service.\nSecurity Operations Managers share in On-Call responsibilities and need to ensure proper coverage for escalations and emergencies. The Security department maintains a series of On-Call escalations to ensure that every reported incident is responded to in a reasonable timeframe.\nOn-Call scheduling for SIRT is organized in Pager Duty within the\nSecurity Responder\npolicy.\nOn-Call scheduling for Trust & Safety is organized in Pager Duty within the\nTrust & Safety Responder\npolicy.\nOn-Call Security Handoffs\nTimes\nStandard handoff times are as scheduled. However, team members are empowered to agree on a temporary modified handoff schedule as long as all those involved agree and the team is notified about changes.\nSIRT (November - April)\n23:00 to 07:00 UTC  APAC - 8 hours\n07:00 to 15:00 UTC  EMEA - 8 hours\n15:00 to 23:00 UTC  AMER - 8 hours\nSIRT (April - November)\n22:00 to 06:00 UTC  APAC - 8 hours\n06:00 to 14:00 UTC  EMEA - 8 hours\n14:00 to 22:00 UTC  AMER - 8 hours\nSIRT times are reflected in the\nSIRT Handoffs\ncalendar. In case both parties agree to change the time, this should be reflected in the calendar at least 24 hours prior to the handoff. This allows other team members the ability to adequately plan their schedules the night before. Changing the meeting time counts as a notification.\nTrust and Safety\n23:00 to 07:00 UTC  APAC - 8 hours\n07:00 to 15:00 UTC  EMEA - 8 hours\n15:00 to 23:00 UTC  AMER - 8 hours\nSIRT Written Handoff\nIncident issues are the SSoT for any incident. Be sure to include any significant incident updates within the incident summaries.\nSIRT is using the self-developed tool\nHandogotchi\n(check\npromotion of Handogotchi on Tine\n) for written handover summaries. Handogotchi reminds the SIRT engineer on call to update incidents and add additional information one hour before handoff time. It will automatically send links to open incidents half an hour before handoff times.\nWritten handoffs are required to be completed at least half an hour before the end of every shift and are the basis for warm handoffs.\nFor all incidents, we highly encourage pausing after no longer than one hour to document and make it a general habit to keep documentation up to date after every work step. For all questions on documentation, please consult the\nIncident Report Writing Guide\nSIRT Warm Handoff\nSIRT uses warm handoffs to clarify written handoffs and avoid misunderstandings in complex situations. They should take no more than 15 minutes. One person per region is required (outgoing and incomming).\nThe outgoing region prepares the handoff as described in the section above. The incoming region should familiarize themselves with the written handoff before attending the meeting.\nTeam members should be prepared for warm handoff meetings, so that the meetings will be efficient, with a focus on open questions and clarifications.\nBecause the incidents are well documented, there is no written agenda for warm handoffs. All significant discussion points that come up must be immediately documented and corrected in the incident issue.\nWarm handoffs are only required during the week. This is because warm handoffs would otherwise have to be performed at around midnight on weekends for EMEA.\nSIRT On-Call\nDuring all On-Call shifts, the On-Call Engineer is filling the role of the\n\"Triage Engineer\"\n.\nWeekday\nWeekday On-Call Engineer Responsibilities\nSecurity Operations provides weekday On-Call coverage using a follow-the-sun model. Weekday On-Call Security Engineers are the team members that cover the On-Call responsibilities during their regions sunny time.\nA Weekday On-Call shift typically covers one work week, from Monday to Friday.\nThe Weekday On-Call Security Engineer is expected to cover the\n\"Triage Engineer\"\nrole, and should be the first responder to alerts and incidents as they are presented via PagerDuty and via the various Slack and alerting channels.\nWeekend\nWeekend On-Call Security Responsibilities\nThe Weekend On-Call Security team member will be responsible for covering On-Call responsibilities from AMER Friday evening until APAC Monday morning according to the established On-Call Security Handoff times.\nThe Weekend On-Call Security team member is responsible for timely responding to PagerDuty and the incident response process in accordance with the\n\"Triage Engineer\"\nrole.\nDuring the weekend hours, the Weekend On-Call Security team member is not expected to be at their computer working unless they are responding to an incident, triaging alerts, or working on a leadership request for critical deliverables. However, they will be asked to acknowledge any Pager Duty incidents via their mobile phone within 15 minutes, and begin triaging the incident within one hour. Priority 3 Severity 3 and below incidents can be handled by the team as weekday tasks.\nThe Weekend On-Call is responsible to acknowledge, and triage all alerts once a day. Resulting incidents should be either worked or delegated according to the triage guidelines. See\n\"Alert Triage\"\nfor details.\nWhen there is a signficant business need, the Weekend On-Call Security team member may be responsible for ensuring continuity of critical deliverables as determined by leadership. Critical deliverables will generally consist of, but are not limited to: threat hunting and mitigation, bug fixes, cryptomining, customer impacting SPAM, or detection and response engineering to protect against credible threats.\nWeekend On-Call Security Scheduling\nWeekend On-Call slots will be filled on a volunteer basis, meaning team members can sign up for the slots that would fit their schedules. The SIRT and Trust and Safety teams will have individual Weekend On-Call schedules so that one person from each team will cover the Weekend On-Call shift. General guidance is that team members should volunteer for the appropriate ratio of qualified team members to weekends requiring coverage. For example, in a team of 12 qualified team members, volunteering for 4 to 5 weekends per year, per person would allow for full coverage. Please note, ratios may change from time to time depending on the size of the team.\nIf there are open remaining slots, the Security Operations managers will assign slots to team members who have not hit their target amount of slots. For example, if theres an open slot and a team member that should volunteer for 4 to 5 slots but has signed up for 2, the Manager can allocate the slot to that team member. If the team member is unavailable, they would be responsible for finding a replacement.\nIn case of emergencies, managers may seek other volunteers and in rare cases may need to assign coverage.\nWeekend On-Call Security Relief\nCurrent On-Call metrics show an average of less than one weekend page per month.\nBecause busy On-Call weekends sometimes happen, and because the weekend on-call team member needs to triage alerts, in recognition of weekend coverage, GitLab is proactively asking team members to take the next two business days off following their Weekend On-Call shift as time off in lieu, regardless of whether the team member had to respond to an incident.\nWhen scheduled for the Weekend On-Call Security shift, team members should:\nSubmit time off in lieu for the next two business days immediately following their Weekend On-Call shift. Because this time off is intended to provide team members with immediate relief, these days cannot be moved to days later in the week or month, regardless of other planned or unplanned time off.\nIf a holiday or Friends and Family day falls on the next business day, time off in lieu can be taken for the subsequent two days.\nCommit to covering the Weekend On-Call shift. Avoid signing up for weekends you are unable to cover, or otherwise have a conflict.\nFind replacement coverage if you cannot commit to covering the entire weekend.\nScheduling Time Off for SIRT\nTo ensure incidents are not left unattended, SIRT team members must complete the following steps before scheduling planned time off:\nEnsure proper coverage for any on-call shifts during the planned time off\nClose any incidents that are ready for closure\nReassign open incidents to another available team member\nManager Responsibility\n: Managers are accountable for ensuring that all assigned incidents are properly handed over before a team members time off. If this process is not completed, managers will ensure coverage for any outstanding incidents.\nSIRT On-Call Paging\nOn-Call Paging Workflow\nThe SIRT On-Call paging workflow is currently designed to follow this escalation path:\nThe first notification goes to our incident slack channel.\nThe designated Security Engineer On-Call in the sunny region is paged after 5 minutes of no response.\nAll Security Engineers in the sunny region are paged after 10 minutes of no response. During the weekend, one person will have volunteered for sole responsibility of weekend coverage. Team members not designated as the Security Engineer On-Call can and should provide assistance if the Security Engineer On-Call misses the page. When weekend assistance is provided, team members should request taking time off in lieu with their manager, and target 1:1 (hour for hour) time off, immediately following the weekend as long as proper coverage is available.\nThe Security Operations manager in the sunny region is paged as a backup after 15 minutes if the team members dont acknowledge the pages.\nSecurity Managers who volunteer as backups are paged if SIRT does not acknowledge the previous pages after 15 minutes.\nThe VP of Security Operations is paged if Security Managers dont acknowledge the pages after 15 minutes.\nSIRT On-Call Paging Duties\nThe On-Call Engineers primary concern is to provide timely and adequate responses to incoming pages. When receiving a page:\nAcknowledge the alarm in the corresponding alert Slack channel or through PagerDuty directly.\nReview incidents GitLab issue and follow the checklists posted there for triaging.\nIf the alarm is not acknowledged, the Security Incident Manager On-Call will be alerted.\nEngineers should acknowledge pages within the first 15 minutes, and start performing initial triage of potential incidents within the first hour of the initial page.\nSecurity Managers On-Call\nIn addition to the Security Engineers being On-Call, the Security Managers across the GitLab Security Department act as backups in the event the Security Engineers are unable to acknowledge security pages. PagerDuty will automatically engage the Security Manager On-Call if SIRT doesnt acknowledge the paging attempts.\nIts the responsibility of the Security Manager On-Call to:\nBe available via mobile phone during their On-Call shift if the Security Engineer On-Call does not acknowledge a page.\nAttempt to contact the Security Engineer On-Call to acknowledge the page.\nNote: If Slack is not available or an alternative means of communication is required, PagerDuty has cell phone numbers of GitLab team members involved in the on-call process. GitLab also sets up a Zoom channel (#Slack Down!) as backup communication channel.\nIf the Security Engineer On-Call is unresponsive, attempt to contact other Engineers to take on the page. Prioritize based on timezone and region.\nIn the event of a high-impact security incident to GitLab, the Security Manager On-Call will be engaged to assist with cross-team/department coordination.\nTriage Engineer\nDuring On-Call shifts the Security Engineer On-Call is the Triage DRI and has these core responsibilities:\nAcknowledge and triage pages; delegate\nMonitor and triage incidents; delegate\nMonitor and triage alerts; delegate alerts that are for their own activity; delegate resulting incidents\nContinue critical assignments as determined by management\nWeekday only:\nMonitor and respond to security related slack channels; delegate\nImprove on-call and incident handling processes - document on-call related problems and improvement opportunities by opening issues and any necessary support tickets (e.g. Devo support).\nContinue ongoing work where possible\nTriage Engineer Responsibility to delegate\nDelegation allows the team to spread the workload across the global team while maintaining adequate coverage and response times. It also minimizes the risk of one single person having to handle spikes in incident volume.\nOn-Call Engineers must delegate incidents to other Engineers after performing initial triage.\nDelegation guidelines:\nIncidents classified with either S1, P1, S2, or P2 should only be delegated to team members available in the current sunny region.\nAll other incidents can be assigned to any team member not out of office in any region.\nSometimes, team members are working on a high-priority, time sensitive assignment and are temporarily unavailable for delegation. These situations should be communicated to the team transparently. If those team members inadvertently receive delegated incidents, they should work with their manager for assistance in incident reassignment.\nThe On-Call Engineer is the last resort if no other team member is available to work on high-urgency incidents.\nTriage Process\nIncident Triage\nIncidents are triaged by following the checklist posted by the TriageBot.\nAlert Triage\nAlert triage is a continuous task on weekdays and a task that should be done at least once a day on weekends.\nAny alert can be converted to an incident and assigned to another team member following the triage delegation guidelines above.\nIncident Ownership\nWhoever is assigned to the incident after the initial triage is the person responsible for incident resolution. Use the assignee field in the GitLab incident to identify the responsible person. In case of a priority 1 incident, it should have one assignee per region. In these cases, the work should continue around the globe until the incident is contained and the priority lowered. In that case, the incident should go back to only having one assignee and DRI. When multiple people work on one incident, work is divided into tasks with their corresponding assignees.\nOwnership of an incident means being the person responsible for:\nEnsuring continued progression to a contained and resolved state\nMaintaining ongoing 24/7 coverage of high-severity incidents\nAccurate and timely issue tracking and communication with stakeholders\nAdequate documentation and communications\nBeing the responsible person does not imply being the sole person to perform incident tasks. Team members from all departments can be called upon to assist in incident resolution, and these requests should be documented as a task or related issue.\nExceptions\nExceptions to this procedure will be tracked as per the\nInformation Security Policy Exception Management Process\n.\nLast modified September 2, 2025:\nUpdate file secops-oncall.md to include \"Scheduling Time Off process for SIRT\" (\n879b92a1\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
