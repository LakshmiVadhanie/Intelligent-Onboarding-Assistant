It is not prescriptive\nregarding how Engineering Managers and Engineers might coordinate across\nmultiple teams to execute on large-scale cross-functional projects like those\ndefined by\narchitecture evolution blueprints\n.\nArchitecture Evolution Workflow\nis complex, and has\nmany steps that make it difficult to adopt the workflow and to succeed with\nwith using it to deliver larger, long-term initiatives.\nIn its current form, the\nArchitecture Evolution Workflow\nis not leveraged for many initiatives within departments of Engineering. Without\na unified roadmap of our own, it is difficult to weigh priorities against\nProducts own roadmap.\nExit Criteria\nThe charter of this working group is to define and implement the next iteration of the\nArchitecture Evolution Workflow\n.\nWe want to make it easier and more intuitive to use the Workflow, but also to\nimprove the process itself, to position team members better for delivering\ngreat results by using it.\nFirm up the definition of Architecture and Blueprint in this context.\nTake inventory of current and historical\nEngineering Allocation\ninitiatives and evaluate the extent to which such initiatives could be defined as\nblueprints\n, following the\nArchitecture Evolution Workflow\n.\nLower the entry barrier for creating a proposal in a blueprint.\nEstablish criteria for when a blueprint should be used.\nIdentify cross-functional touchpoints and consolidate upstream processes like\nproduction readiness\n,\nAppSec reviews\n,\nand\ncreation of release posts\n.\nDevelop strategy for incorporating this process and the Engineering roadmap into Product planning\nand prioritization via the\nCross-functional Prioritization\nframework.\nContext\nThe\nArchitecture Evolution Workflow\nis complex, spans\nmultiple tools and projects, and is not something external contributors can\nparticipate in.\nArchitecture Blueprints\nprovide great context and detail, but\nthey are completely disconnected from Product prioritization and thus rarely\npicked up into the workstream.\nWorking Groups\ninvolving technical\ninitiatives have a low rate of success. Many\nchoose\nto produce blueprints\nas part of their exit criteria, but blueprints are not standard and do very\nlittle to ensure the work gets done.\nCross-functional Prioritization\naims to replace\nEngineering Allocations\nbut is not prescriptive\nregarding how efforts involving engineers across multiple Product stages will\nbe coordinated.\nThe following recording from the\nRate Limit Architecture\nWorking Group included some organic discussion around this topic as we attempt\nto redefine exit criteria that will result in a successful implementation after\nthe working group concludes:\nNote:\nthe video is private. Try\nthis link\nif the embedded video is not playable.\nPrior Efforts\nArchitecture Kickoff Working Group\nThe\nArchitecture Kickoff\nworking group\nwas primarily concerned with\ndefining a 3/6/12-month technical roadmap\n.\nThis working group picks up by further iterating on the process for maintaining this roadmap over time\nand better facilitating its implementation.\nSpecial Interest Groups\nWe have previously attempted to introduce a new organizational structure for facilitating cross-functional\nwork in the form of Special Interest Groups (SIGs)\n(see\ngitlab-com/www-gitlab-com!104378\n),\nbut it was difficult to demonstrate incremental value with this approach.\nWe hope to see more success by focusing on the consolidation and streamlining of existing process\nand improving the success rate of working groups in their current form first.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nWorking Group Role\nPerson\nTitle\nDRI\nMarshall Cottrell\nPrincipal, Strategy and Operations (Technical)\nExecutive Stakeholder\nChristopher Lefelhocz\nVP of Development\nMember\nGerardo Gerir Lopez-Fernandez\nEngineering Fellow, Infrastructure\nMember\nJoshua Lambert\nDirector of Product, Enablement\nMember\nSam Goldstein\nDirector of Engineering, Ops\nMember\nAndrew Newdigate\nDistinguished Engineer, Infrastructure\nMember\nKamil Trzcinski\nDistinguished Engineer, Ops and Enablement\nMember\nPhilippe Lafoucriere\nSecurity Architect, Security\nMember\nGrzegorz Bizon\nPrincipal Backend Engineer, Ops\nMember\nLucas Charles\nStaff Backend Engineer, Sec::Static Analysis\nMember\nJoao Pereira\nStaff Backend Engineer, Package\nMember\nNatalia Tepluhina\nStaff Frontend Engineer, Plan\nMember\nTyler Amos\nStaff Backend Engineer, Fulfillment Platform\nLast modified April 7, 2025:\nFix broken links (\n0cdabc39\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
