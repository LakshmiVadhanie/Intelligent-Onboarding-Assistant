Such event or circumstance giving rise to the default or delay is hereby referred to as a Force Majeure Event.\n13.2 The Non-performing Party will be excused from any further performance of the non-monetary obligations affected by such Force Majeure Event for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues and the Non-performing Party continues to use commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance.\n13.3 Except as expressly excused in this Section 13, each party will continue to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement during a Force Majeure Event.\n14. SECURITY / DATA PROTECTION\n14.1 Without limiting GitLabs obligations as stated in Section 7 (Confidentiality), GitLab shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining a commercially reasonable information security program that is designed to: (i) ensure the security and confidentiality of the Customer Content; (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the Customer Content; (iii) protect against unauthorized access to, or use of, the Customer Content; and (iv) ensure that all subcontractors of GitLab, if any, comply with all of the foregoing. In no case shall the safeguards of GitLabs information security program be less stringent than the information security safeguards used by GitLab to protect its own commercially sensitive data. Customer shall use commercially reasonable security and anti-virus measures when accessing and using the Software and to prevent unauthorized access to, or use of the Software, and notify GitLab promptly of any such unauthorized access or use of which it becomes aware.\n14.2 With respect to the protection of information, the GitLab Privacy Policy located here\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/privacy/\n, shall apply. If this Agreement is entered into on behalf of an Enterprise, the terms of the data processing addendum at\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/data-processing-agreement/\n(DPA) are hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply to the extent Customer Content includes Personal Data, as defined in the DPA. To the extent Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom and Switzerland are processed by GitLab, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall apply, as further set forth in the DPA. For the purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses, Customer and its applicable Affiliates are each the data exporter, and Customers acceptance of this Agreement, and an applicable Affiliates execution of an Order Form, shall be treated as its execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses.\n14.3 The parties acknowledge and agree that, (i) the Software is not designed for the purpose(s) of storing, processing, compiling or transmitting Sensitive Data (as defined herein), and (ii) Customer shall not use the Software, or otherwise provide to GitLab without prior written consent, Sensitive Data under this Agreement. Sensitive Data means: (i) special categories of data enumerated in European Union Regulation 2016/679, Article 9(1) or any successor legislation; (ii) patient, medical, or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (as amended and supplemented) (HIPAA); (iii) credit, debit, or other payment card data or financial account information, including bank account numbers or other personally identifiable financial information; (iv) social security numbers, drivers license numbers, or other government identification numbers; (v) other information subject to regulation or protection under specific laws such as the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) (or related rules or regulations); or (vi) any data similar to the above protected under foreign or domestic laws. Customer further acknowledges that the Software and related features are not intended to meet any legal obligations for these uses, including HIPAA and GLBA requirements, and that GitLab is not a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA. Therefore, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, GitLab has no liability for Sensitive Data processed in connection with Customers use of the Software.\n15. MISCELLANEOUS\n15.1 If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\n15.2 This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by either party without the other partys prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that either party may transfer and/or assign this Agreement to a successor in the event of a sale of all, or substantially all, of its business or assets to which this Agreement relates.\n15.3 This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

Recent status, references to availability measurement definition, and historical reporting will be available at or linked from the GitLab system status site located at\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/monitoring/#gitlabcom-service-level-availability\n.\nRESILIENCY\nGitLab will architect and maintain an underlying cloud infrastructure with commercially reasonable resiliency for all data, compute, and network services. At a minimum, GitLab will maintain the highest documented level of GitLab Reference Architecture as detailed at\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com\n.\nBACKUPS\nGitLab will maintain a commercially reasonable system of data backup process and technology to ensure that primary data sources remain recoverable in the event of various system failures.\nMONITORING AND INCIDENT RESPONSE\nGitLab will employ a system of instrumentation and observation tools to ensure that system behavior which may limit use of the SaaS Software is detected and announced. GitLab will also employ industry reasonable practices to maintain appropriate engineering personnel availability for the purposes of incident response(s).\nUPDATES AND UPGRADES\nGitLab will update the SaaS Software as updates are available and when reasonably practical to implement said updates. Update timing and process will remain at GitLabs discretion.\nSCHEDULED SYSTEM MAINTENANCE\nGitLab will occasionally perform scheduled system maintenance which requires limits to the use of part or all of the SaaS Software features, or significantly reduces features and functions during the scheduled system maintenance period. GitLab will provide ten (10) business days notice for all scheduled system maintenance activities. GitLab will take a proactive approach to minimizing the need for such maintenance and will limit scheduled system maintenance to less than four (4) hours per calendar month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of emergency or urgent issue which may negatively impact GitLabs customers, GitLab has the right to carry out unscheduled maintenance to remedy such instance(s). For the avoidance of doubt, such unscheduled maintenance shall: (i) be limited to only those issues which may negatively impact customers; and (ii) will be carried out in such a manner to provide for the least amount of disruption to customers.\nSUSPENSION OF SERVICE\nGitLab reserves the right to suspend service to the SaaS Software if: (i) Customer fails to comply with the Agreement and this Appendix, (ii) Customer exceeds set application limits, or (iii) requests or usage deemed malicious in nature is identified to be sourced from Customer accounts, personnel, or systems.\nLast modified September 4, 2024:\nUpdate old links and exclude legacy agreements (\n2c86c7fb\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
