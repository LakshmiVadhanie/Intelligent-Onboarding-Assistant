  "content": "Security Department Gearing Ratios\nGearing ratios are used as\nBusiness Drivers\nto forecast long term financial goals by function.\nBug bounties\nThe gearing ratio for bug bounty expenditure is as follows:\nThe cost of a compromise is estimated at 1% of company worth\nBug Bounty budget is determined as 10% of a compromise\nBug Bounty top reward is determined as 1% of budget\nAn illustration:\nGitLab is worth 3.5 billion and a significant compromise can cost GitLab $35 million.\n10% ratio = $3.5 million budget. Likewise, 1% of budget = $35,000 top reward\nApproximate monthly budget should be set at total budget divided by 12. It should be understood that our bug bounty payouts are largely unpredictable and fluctuate based on the following:\nNumber and severity of bugs produced by GitLab and pushed to production\nParticipation of research community\nReward ranges\nThis gearing ratio is owned by the\nProduct Security\nSub-department. The cost of a compromise should be re-evaluated at least annually based on the average market cap of GTLB over the previous 6 months.\nSecurity Incident Response Team (SIRT) size\nSIRT is the sole carrier of the Security On-Call (SEOC) rotation, which ensures that theres a page-able Security Engineer 24/7/365. The baseline and gearing ratio for the size of the SIRT\nhave been agreed on\nas outlined below:\nBaseline:\n12 team members to cover 3 timezone in a 8 hour, follow-the-sun rotation:\n4 team members in JAPAC\n4 team members in EMEA\n4 team members in AMER\nGearing ratio that triggers a review of team size:\nIf number of pages to SEOC per month exceeds +50% of monthly average of the last 12 months for 3 consecutive months\nIf number of pages to SEOC per year exceeds +100% of previous year\nIf number of total team members increases by +20% compared to previous year\nThis gearing ratio is owned by the\nSecurity Operations\nSub-department.\nSecurity Compliance Team Staffing\nThe weighted gearing ratio for Security Compliance team size accounts for\ncertification complexity:\nCertification Complexity Weighting:\nHigh Complexity (2.0 FTE): FedRAMP, DoD\nMedium Complexity (1.0 FTE): ISO standards, PCI DSS, ISMAP, IRAP, CMMC\nStandard Complexity (0.5 FTE): SOC 2, TISAX, Cyber Essentials\nFormula\n: Required FTE = Î£(Active Certifications Complexity Weight) +\n1 Core Operations Staff\nThis ratio should be re-evaluated when:\nAdding certifications that introduce new geographic or regulatory domains\nCertification requirements significantly change\nAutomation capabilities reduce manual effort by 30%\nThis gearing ratio is owned by the Security Compliance team and should be\nre-evaluated annually during budget planning.\nSecurity Compliance External Audit Budget\nAnnual audit budget is tiered based on certification complexity and requirements:\nBudget Tiers:\nTier 1 ($200-300K): FedRAMP, DoD, ISMAP\nTier 2 ($100-150K): ISO 27001, IRAP, CMMC\nTier 3 ($50-75K): SOC 2, PCI SAQ, TISAX, ISO, Cyber Essentials\nBudget should include 10% contingency for scope changes and remediation\nvalidation audits.\nThis gearing ratio is owned by the Security Compliance team and should be\nre-evaluated annually during budget planning.\nLast modified October 14, 2025:\nRemove trailing spaces (\n3643eb9e\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
