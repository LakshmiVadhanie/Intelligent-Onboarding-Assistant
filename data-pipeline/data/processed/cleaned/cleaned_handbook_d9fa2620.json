  "content": "Cloud Cost Utilization Team\nThe\nCloud Cost Utilization function\nbrings experience in both Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Software Engineering (SWE), leveraging these skills to optimize the financial operations of our cloud services and data resources. This technical expertise enables us to not only ensure alignment with financial objectives but also drive operational efficiency at scale. Our teams deep understanding of cloud cost structures, infrastructure, data management, and automation empowers us to manage the full lifecycle of cloud consumption, from cost allocation to detailed analysis, while maintaining the high standards of reliability and performance expected in modern cloud environments.\nTeam\nEM: @lmcandrew, SRE: @tonyganga, @irotman\nIssue Tracker\nCloud Cost Utilization Issue Tracker\nFramework Board\nCloud Cost Utilization Framework Activities\nSlack\n#g_finops\nOur Core Responsibilities\nWe focus on several key activities:\nAnalysis of costs related to cloud infrastructure.\nProviding insights into cloud resource utilization, identifying inefficiencies, and helping stakeholders optimize their spend.\nProvide analysis on spend trends, forecasting future expenses, and helping teams plan their budgets accordingly.\nHelping stakeholders access and interpret the cloud cost data they need for decision-making.\nWe achieve these responsbilies by:\nForecasting\n: To help predict future cloud spending based on historical trends, planned initiatives, and business growth patterns. Accurate forecasting enables proactive budget planning, prevents unexpected cost overruns, and supports strategic decision-making around infrastructure investments and capacity needs.\nBudgeting\n: To ensure consistent and expected cloud spend across teams and projects by establishing clear financial guardrails. This process involves setting spending limits, allocating costs to appropriate cost centers, and creating accountability mechanisms that align cloud consumption with business objectives and financial constraints.\nWastage Monitoring (Resource Optimization)\n: To proactively ensure efficient resource utilization by identifying and eliminating unnecessary spending. This includes detecting idle resources, rightsizing over-provisioned instances, removing orphaned assets, and optimizing reserved capacity to maximize the value derived from every dollar spent on cloud infrastructure.\nLabel Compliance (Tagging Strategy)\n: To ensure the fundamentals of our infrastructure are properly attributed, which forms the bedrock of proper reporting. Consistent tagging enables accurate cost allocation and granular visibility into spending patterns across teams, projects, environments, and business units.\nIts important to also call out there is a lifecycle to these items and it all starts with\nLabel Compliance\n.\nEffective cloud resource and cost management begins with Label Compliance to establish proper attribution and visibility, which then enables three parallel disciplines:\nBudgeting\nto set spending guardrails and accountability,\nForecasting\nto predict and plan for future spend\nWastage Monitoring\nto continuously identify optimization opportunities\nAll three work simultaneously and interdependently once the foundational tagging strategy is in place.\nOur Goals\nEnable comprehensive cost visibility and accountability\nBuild and maintain the foundational infrastructure for accurate cost tracking (tagging, account structure, governance)\nEstablish clear cost allocation and real-time spending visibility across teams and business units\nCreate dashboards and reporting that tie infrastructure cloud costs directly to business outcomes and ownership (DRI-level attribution)\nDrive proactive cost optimization and efficiency\nIdentify and eliminate infrastructure cloud waste through continuous monitoring of spending patterns\nImplement cost-saving strategies like right-sizing, reserved instances, and spot pricing\nWork with engineering teams to optimize resource usage without compromising performance\nTrack and measure optimization impact\nEstablish governance and enable cost-conscious culture\nImplement automated controls, approval workflows, and policies to prevent cost overruns while enabling velocity\nSupport budget planning, spending alerts, and proactive cost management\nCreate infrastructure-as-code standards that enforce cost best practices\nFoster cost awareness and accountability throughout the engineering organization\nHow We Work\nIf something requires immediate attention, please tag the relevant person/team in the GitLab issue and include a clear description of the urgency.\nDMs and ad-hoc requests can lead to duplicated work or missed context and should be avoided in favor of formal issue submission. Slack should be used primarily for quick clarifications or urgent escalations but not for initiating work requests.\nWhenever possible, we encourage stakeholders to refer to the data available in our data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, Google BigQuery, etc) to find the data they need. When in doubt,\ncheck dbt\n. If you still cant find what you need, reach out to us in an issue.\nWork Requests:\nAll tasks and requests should be tracked via\nissues in GitLab\n. This allows for clear documentation, prioritization, and tracking of requests.\nRoadmap\n: Our\nroadmap\nis updated weekly.\nEducating Stakeholders\nWe encourage stakeholders to access our data repositories and take ownership of their use cases and views. We do our best to ensure data we find useful finds its way into our\ndata warehouse\n.\nImportant:\nThe Cloud Cost Utilization team does not create or maintain dashboards (including Tableau) for other teams, as this requires deep domain knowledge that resides with the business stakeholders. Creating dashboards for the entire business is not scalable for our small team and would detract from our core responsibilities of cost analysis and optimization.\nWe provide the necessary data foundation, but visualization and dashboard creation are the responsibility of the teams who best understand their specific needs and data context.\n\nNeed Tableau help?\nThe Data team provides documentation on\ngetting started with Tableau\n.\nEngaging with Stakeholders\nWe manage a variety of stakeholder relationships across the organization. Each stakeholder group has specific needs, and we aim to support them in a way thats both efficient and scalable.\nFP&A:\nProvide cost insights and analysis for financial forecasting.\nData Teams (PDI & AI):\nCollaborate to ensure the data required from our stakeholders is present in the data warehouse. This ensures structure and aligns with both operational and financial needs.\nEngineering and Infrastructure:\nWork closely with engineering teams to analyze resource utilization and identify cost-saving opportunities in cloud infrastructure.\nLast modified October 21, 2025:\nFinOps - Cloud Cost Utilization (\n89129336\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
