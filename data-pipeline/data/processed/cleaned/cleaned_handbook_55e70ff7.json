  "content": "AnswerBase Quality Guide\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this guide is to establish quality expectations for AnswerBase.\nQuality Expectations\nAnswers\nAnswers in AnswerBase should have the following characteristics:\nMore than just a\nyes\nor\nno\nanswer\nAnswers should contain a supporting narrative.\nThe supporting narrative should accurately explain why we are answering\nyes\nor\nno\nto a question.\nThe supporting narrative should refer back to a control, product feature, policy/procedure, etc. that justifies our\nyes\nor\nno\nanswer.\nWe are not obligated to provide the supporting narratives to customers in questionnaires.\nThe supporting narratives will enhance all team members understanding of the topics covered by the answers.\nThe supporting narratives will help establish AnswerBase as a true knowledgebase for all team members.\nAnswers will be reviewed for accuracy on at least an annual basis.\nTags\nAnswers should have tags assigned to them.\nTags will support quicker and smoother searching for team members.\nTags will be reviewed for accuracy on at least an annual basis.\nLibraries\nLibraries should have appropriate names and descriptions assigned to them.\nThe names should describe the nature of the answers contained within each library.\nThe descriptions should further describe the nature of the answers contained within each library so every team member accurately understands what they are viewing when they enter a library.\nLibraries that are not populated with content should have\n(COMING SOON)\nappended to the library name.\nLibrary owners should represent the SME responsible for maintaining the library.\nThe justification for a librarys existence should be evaluated on an annual basis.\nLibraries should be decomissioned when their existence is no longer justified.\nLibraries should have a decomissioned date, which should be communicated through the library description. Example:\n***This library is set for decommissioning on YYYY/MM/DD*** Description of Library\nThe decomissioned date should be 30 days after a library is determined to be unjustified.\nLast modified June 6, 2024:\nRemove ul-indent exception and fix errors (\n5c73f128\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
