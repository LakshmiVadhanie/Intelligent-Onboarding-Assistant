Note that this video is private.\n Introduction\nThe Community Programs team supports communities that align with GitLabs CREDIT values by executing specific programs that help these communities grow and thrive. Our mission is to help these communities experience GitLabs vision of a world where everyone can contribute. Learn more about\nCommunity Programs in the GitLab handbook\n.\n What is a community program?\nGitLabs community programs aim to put GitLabs most powerful features in the hands of communities who may not otherwise have the means to access to them. Each program is unique in its organization and execution; however, in general, community programs offer GitLab customers benefits like:\nComplimentary subscriptions to GitLab Ultimate\nDirect lines of communication to GitLab team members\nOpportunities to partner with GitLab for presentations and events\nThrough these programs, we seek to raise awareness of GitLab in specific markets. We do this by partnering with members of these communities to spotlight (via case studies, articles, webcasts, and videos) ways theyre using GitLab to achieve success.\n Meet the programs\nLearn more about GitLabs community programs and their respective DRIs in the\nCommunity Programs handbook pages\n.\n Rules of engagement\nAccount and Opportunity Ownership\nSee point 13 on the\nGo to Market Rules of Engagement Handbook page\nfor details on handling accounts with a Community Programs-related opportunity.\nPlease note that even if there is not a sales related opportunity on an account, all accounts must remain in the AE/SAE name. If a Community Programs-related opportunity is incorrectly in the AE/SAE name, please chatter @Sales-Support in SFDC for assistance with changing the owner to the proper Community Programs team member.\nLead routing\nGitLab does not currently have routing in place for leads related to Community Programs. If you are routed a lead that has contacted GitLab about a Community Program, please reply directly to the lead with the appropriate response whenever possible. Consider using one of\nCommunity Programs email templates\nto structure correspondence. Replying directly provides the optimal experience for the wider community member and the most efficient path for everyone.\nPlease use the\nlead routing workflow\nto determine the best course of action.\nPlease do not forward leads or emails from individual program members to Community Programs team members personal email addresses. With 4,700 license holders (and growing), we are not able to provide efficient and optimal response times from personal email addresses.\n Community program application cycle\nIn Q3FY23, Community Programs launched an automated system which allows wider community members to apply, receive verification, and obtain new or renewed subscriptions directly through a specific portal on\ngitlab.customers.com\n. After successful verification, applicants will receive a coupon code to use in the Community Self-Checkout Portal.\nBelow are details on the application process most pertinent to Sales team members. To learn about the application and renewal process in its entirety, please see the\nCommunity Programs Applications Automated Workflow\nhandbook page.\nApplication\nThe Community Programs team uses a third party vendor,\nSheerID\n, to host the application forms for its programs. More details are in the\nApplication\nsection of the Community Programs handbook page.\nImportant points:\nIf a community members educational institution or country is not listed in the SheerID form, they should email\neducation@gitlab.com\nand let us know.\nIf a community member applying to the GitLab for Education Program believes theyve been falsely rejected, they should contact SheerID per the instructions in the rejection email.\nVerification\nSheerID provides automated verification for applications to the GitLab for Education Program, while the Community Programs Associate Program Manager manually reviews applications for the open source and startups programs. Additional details are in the\nVerification\nsection of the Community Programs handbook page.\nImportant points:\nFor applications to the education program, the Community Programs team does not require proof of use case nor do we enforce it. The applying entity agrees to our legal termsuse case includedas described in the Education Program Agreement\nPurpose section\n.\nFor applications to the open source program, the Community Programs team requires proof of use case at the time of application (new and renewing) in the form of a screenshot. The applying entity agrees to our legal termsuse case includedas described in the Open Source Program Agreement\n2.Purpose & Eligibility Section\n. If a SAE/AE has concerns regarding potential violation of the use case, please contact our team in the #community-programs channel and provide the SFDC opportunity in question.\nIn the case that a community program member no longer meets the program requirements, the Community Programs team works with the sales team to identify a path forward to transition from free to paid.\nBooking\nAfter successful verification, program members receive a coupon code, which members then use in the Community Programs self-checkout portal on CustomerDOT to obtain their subscription license or renew. Additional details are in the\nBooking\nsection of the Community Programs handbook page.\nAdd-ons or license-type changes cannot be made on through self-service. Program members need to\nemail the corresponding program\nwith the request.\nProvisioning\nLicenses will be provisioned directly during process via the WebDirect flow.\nCompliance\nSales Support and Billing Ops handle compliance. This phase results in granting the subscription license and notifying the customer of how to access the subscription.\nRenewal\nCommunity program members need to renew their subscriptions annually.\nSelf-checkout renewal functionality on CustomerDOT launched in 2022-09. Program members use the same form for both new and renewing subscriptions. For renewal instructions please see the programs respective\nmarketing pages\n. Additional details on the renewal process are in the\nRenewal\nsection of the Community Programs handbook page.\nImportant points:\nFor any inbound requests for renewals, direct the community member to the self-service instructions rather than forwarding an email or carbon copying an email to a community program team members personal GitLab email address. Given the volume of program members, we cannot provide optimal service from our personal email addresses.\nAt this time, the Community Programs team does not actively conduct outreach for renewals or manage renewal opportunities in SFDC. If the automatically generated renewal opportunity expires before the community program member reaches out for renewal, the SAE/AE has the option to request that the opportunity be closed-lost. No other action is required.\nStartup subscriptions are valid for one year only. Renewals must be paid after the initial 12-month, zero-dollar subscription license has expired. Special pricing does not exist. The community programs team does not actively route Startups program members to the sales team at this time.\nSupport\nDetails on the Support workflow for Community Programs are in the\nSupport\nsection of the Community Programs handbook page.\nImportant points:\nProgram members do not receive Ultimate support with subscriptions granted through community programs. They are able to open a support ticket via the\nGitLab Support Portal\nwith errors involving the Community Self-checkout Portal on CustomersDOT or any errors relating to their subscription.\nIf GitLab for Education applicants are having issues during the application or verification stages, they first contact SheerID as indicated in the\nSupport table\n.\n Engaging with the Community Programs team\nYou can engage with our team asynchronously by:\nUsing our Slack channel,\n#community-programs\nTagging us in account-related conversations on Salesforce\nUsing our Slack channel,\n#gitlab-for-campuses\nfor questions regarding the\nGitLab for Campuses\npaid offering.\nWe are also happy to meet with you for synchronous coffee chats or join you for meetings with customers.\nLast modified October 22, 2025:\nUpdate from Community to Strategy programs (path and main page) (\n6ec47bdd\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
