  "content": "Upgrading applications to newer, supported versions of Java has traditionally been a tedious and time-consuming process. Development teams must spend countless hours learning about deprecated APIs, updated libraries, and new language features. In many cases, significant code rewrites are necessary, turning what should be a straightforward upgrade into a multi-week project that diverts resources from building new features.\nGitLab Duo with Amazon Q\nchanges this paradigm entirely with AI-powered automation. What once took weeks can now be accomplished in minutes, with full traceability and ready-to-review merge requests that maintain your application's functionality while leveraging modern Java features.\nHow it works: Upgrade your Java application\nLet's walk through how you can modernize a Java 8 application to Java 17.\nStart with an issue\nFirst, create an issue in your GitLab project describing your modernization goal. You don't need to specify version details - GitLab Duo with Amazon Q is able to detect that your application is currently built with Java 8 and needs to be upgraded. Simply describe that you want to refactor your code to Java 17 in the issue title and description.\nTrigger the transformation\nOnce your issue is created, invoke GitLab Duo with Amazon Q using the\n/q transform\ncommand in a comment on the issue. This simple command sets in motion an automated process that will analyze your entire codebase, create a comprehensive upgrade plan, and generate all necessary code changes.\nAutomated analysis and implementation\nBehind the scenes, Amazon Q analyzes your Java 8 codebase to understand your application's structure, dependencies, and implementation patterns. It identifies deprecated features, determines which Java 17 constructs can replace existing code, and creates a merge request with all the necessary updates. The transformation updates not just your source code files â including CLI, GUI, and model classes â but also your build configuration files like\npom.xml\nwith Java 17 settings and dependencies.\nReview and verification\nThe generated merge request provides a complete view of all changes. You can review how your code has been modernized with Java 17 language features and verify that all tests still pass. The beauty of this approach is that all functionality is preserved and your application works exactly the same way, just with improved, more modern code.\nWhy use GitLab Duo with Amazon Q\nLeveraging GitLab Duo with Amazon Q for application modernization has a number of advantages for development teams:\nTime reduction\n: What traditionally takes weeks of developer effort is reduced to hours or minutes, freeing your team to focus on building new features rather than managing technical debt.\nMinimized risk\n: The automated analysis and transformation process reduces the risk of human error that often accompanies manual code migrations. Every change is traceable and reviewable through GitLab's merge request workflow.\nComplete audit trail\n: Every transformation is documented through GitLab's version control, providing a clear record of what changed and why, which is essential for compliance and troubleshooting.\nEnterprise-grade security\n: The integration leverages GitLab's end-to-end security features and AWS's robust cloud infrastructure, helping to ensure your code and data remain protected throughout the modernization process.\nAre you ready to see GitLab Duo with Amazon Q in action?
