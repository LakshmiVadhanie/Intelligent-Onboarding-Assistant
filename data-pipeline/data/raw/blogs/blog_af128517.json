  "content": "For the past six years, I've worked on artifact management at GitLab and have had hundreds of conversations with platform engineers trying to solve the same challenge: managing artifacts when they've become a sprawling, expensive mess. What started as simple Docker registries and Maven repositories has evolved into a complex web of tools, policies, and operational overhead that's consuming more time and budget than anyone anticipated.\nI recently spoke with a platform engineer at a Fortune 500 company who told me, \"I spend more time managing artifact repositories than I do on actual platform improvements.\" That conversation reminded me why we need an honest discussion about the real costs of fragmented artifact management â and what platform teams can realistically do about it. This article will help you better understand the problem and how GitLab can help you solve it through strategic consolidation.\nReal-world impact: The numbers\nBased on data from our customers and industry research, fragmented artifact management typically results in the following costs for a midsize organization (500+ developers):\nLicensing:\n$50,000-200,000 annually across multiple tools\nOperational overhead:\n2-3 FTE's equivalent time spent on artifact management tasks\nStorage inefficiency:\n20%-30% higher storage costs due to duplication and poor lifecycle management\nDeveloper productivity loss:\n15-20 minutes daily per developer due to artifact-related friction\nFor large enterprises, these numbers multiply significantly. One customer calculated they were spending over $500,000 annually just on the operational overhead of managing seven different artifact storage systems.\nThe hidden costs compound daily:\nTime multiplication:\nEvery lifecycle policy, security rule, or access control change must be implemented across multiple systems. What should be a 15-minute configuration becomes hours of work.\nSecurity gap risks:\nManaging security policies across disparate systems creates blind spots. Vulnerability scanning, access controls, and audit trails become fragmented.\nContext switching tax:\nDevelopers lose productivity when they can't find artifacts or need to remember which system stores what.\nThe multiplication problem\nThe artifact management landscape has exploded. Where teams once managed a single Maven repository, today's platform engineers juggle:\nContainer registries (Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, Azure ACR)\nPackage repositories (JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus)\nLanguage-specific registries (npm, PyPI, NuGet, Conan)\nInfrastructure artifacts (Terraform modules, Helm charts)\nML model registries (MLflow, Weights & Biases)\nEach tool comes with its own authentication system, lifecycle policies, security scanning, and operational requirements. For organizations with hundreds or thousands of projects, this creates an exponential management burden.\nGitLab's strategic approach: Depth over breadth\nWhen we started building GitLab's artifact management capabilities six years ago, we faced a classic product decision: support every artifact format imaginable or go deep on the formats that matter most to enterprise teams. We chose depth, and that decision has shaped everything we've built since.\nOur core focus areas\nInstead of building shallow support for 20+ formats, we committed to delivering enterprise-grade capabilities for a strategic set:\nMaven\n(Java ecosystem)\nnpm\n(JavaScript/Node.js)\nDocker/OCI\n(container images)\nPyPI\n(Python packages)\nNuGet\n(C#/.NET packages)\nGeneric packages\n(any binary artifact)\nTerraform modules\n(infrastructure as code)\nThese seven formats account for approximately 80% of artifact usage in enterprise environments, based on our customer data.\nWhat 'enterprise-grade' actually means\nBy focusing on fewer formats, we can deliver capabilities that work in production environments with hundreds of developers, terabytes of artifacts, and strict compliance requirements:\nVirtual registries\n:\nProxy and cache upstream dependencies for reliable builds and supply chain control. Currently production-ready for Maven, with npm and Docker coming in early 2026.\nLifecycle management\n: Automated cleanup policies that prevent storage costs from spiraling while preserving artifacts for compliance. Available at the project level today, organization-level policies planned for mid-2026.\nSecurity integration\n:\nBuilt-in vulnerability scanning, dependency analysis, and policy enforcement. Our upcoming Dependency Firewall (planned for late 2026) will provide supply chain security control across all formats.\nDeep CI/CD integration\n:\nComplete traceability from source commit to deployed artifact, with build provenance and security scan results embedded in artifact metadata.\nCurrent capabilities: Battle-tested features\nMaven virtual registries:\nOur flagship enterprise capability, proven with 15+ enterprise customers. Most complete\nMaven virtual registry\nsetup within two months, with minimal GitLab support required.\nLocally-hosted repositories:\nAll seven supported formats offer complete upload, download, versioning, and access control capabilities supporting critical workloads at organizations with thousands of developers.\nProtected artifacts:\nComprehensive protection preventing unauthorized modifications, supporting fine-grained access controls across all formats.\nProject-level lifecycle policies:\nAutomated cleanup and retention policies for storage cost control and compliance.\nPerformance and scale characteristics\nBased on current production deployments:\nThroughput:\n10,000+ artifact downloads per minute/per instance\nStorage:\nCustomers successfully managing 50+ TB of artifacts\nConcurrent users:\n1,000+ developers accessing artifacts simultaneously\nAvailability:\n99.99% uptime for\nGitLab.com\nfor more than 2 years\nStrategic roadmap: Next 18 months\nQ1 2026\nnpm virtual registries:\nEnterprise proxy/cache for JavaScript packages\nDocker virtual registries:\nContainer registry proxy capabilities\nQ2 2026\nOrganization-level lifecycle policies (Beta):\nCentralized cleanup policies with project overrides\nNuGet virtual registries (Beta):\n.NET package proxy support\nPyPI virtual registries (Beta):\nCompleting virtual registry support for Python\nQ3 2026\nAdvanced Analytics Dashboard:\nStorage optimization and usage insights\nQ4 2026\nDependency Firewall (Beta):\nSupply chain security control for all artifact types\nWhen to choose GitLab: Decision framework\nGitLab is likely the right choice if:\n80%+ of your artifacts are in our seven supported formats\nYou're already using GitLab for source code or CI/CD\nYou value integrated workflows over standalone feature richness\nYou want to reduce the operational complexity of managing multiple systems\nYou need complete traceability from source to deployment\nMigration considerations\nTypical timeline:\n2-4 months for complete migration from Artifactory/Nexus\nCommon challenges:\nVirtual registry configuration, access control mapping, and developer workflow changes\nSuccess factors:\nPhased approach, comprehensive testing, and developer training\nMost successful migrations follow this pattern:\nAssessment\n(2-4 weeks): Catalog current artifacts and usage patterns\nPilot\n(4-6 weeks): Migrate one team/project end-to-end\nRollout\n(6-12 weeks): Gradual migration with parallel systems\nOptimization\n(ongoing): Implement advanced features and policies\nBetter artifact management can start today\nGitLab's artifact management isn't trying to be everything to everyone. We've made strategic trade-offs: deep capabilities for core enterprise formats rather than shallow support for everything.\nIf your artifact needs align with our supported formats and you value integrated workflows, we can significantly reduce your operational overhead while improving developer experience.\nOur goal is to help you make informed decisions about your artifact management strategy with a clear understanding of capabilities and our roadmap.\nPlease reach out to me at\n[email protected]\nto learn more about GitLab artifact management.
