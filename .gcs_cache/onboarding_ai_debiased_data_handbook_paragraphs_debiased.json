    "title": "Legal, Employment at GitLab: A Strategic Partnership",
    "paragraph": "Employment law governs the relationship between employers and employees. At GitLab, the Legal Employment team serves as a strategic partner across the organization, providing expert guidance and proactive legal solutions throughout the entire team member lifecycle. What does this partnership entail? We * collaborate strategically with Sales, Go-to-Market, Finance and People teams to develop scalable, compliant employment solutions as GitLab expands globally and responsibly, implementing a comprehensive process for gathering, assessing, and acting on country-specific information. We empower the Talent Acquisition department to achieve its critical goals while ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations during sourcing, recruitment, and hiring processes. We enable the People Operations team to effectively onboard and support team members with location- and role-specific legal support, setting team members up for success from day one. We partner with the Total Rewards team, People Operations team and People Business Partners to develop forward-thinking policies that balance GitLab’s business objectives, team members’ needs, and global legal requirements. We provide strategic counsel to our Team Member Relations team, People Business Partners, and Total Rewards as they navigate complex team member matters, including reasonable accommodation requests, performance management, career progression, and other relationship dynamics. We champion our Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging initiatives by aligning all employment decisions with our mission statement and applicable laws. We safeguard GitLab’s interests while also providing fair treatment during employment transitions, including offboarding processes and post-employment matters. To work with the Legal Employment team, reach out early in your process, provide complete information about your needs and any time constraints you have. Being specific about what you’re requesting and any deadlines you face will enable the Legal Employment team to best triage requests and support you. To connect with Legal Employment, especially on sensitive matters, you can use the ’ legal-employment@gitlab.com ’ email address, or for non-sensitive queries, you can reach out in the #legal slack channel. Note that GitLab team members with individual employment queries should reach out to Team Member Relations team on ’ teammemberrelations@gitlab.com ’ or to their aligned People Business Partner for support. For cross-functional projects that do not involve individual team members but do require the Legal Employment team’s attention, please (i) open an Issue in the Legal and Compliance Project ; (ii) select the appropriate Issue Template; (iii) apply the label legal-employment :: to-do and (iv) if you know which Legal team member you will be working with, include them as an Assignee. This will update the Legal Employment Issue Board for the Employment team’s benefit, and allow the team to pick up and/or assign appropriately. A table showing coverage for queries by subject matter is available for internal use and can be accessed here . You are welcome to consult any member of the Legal Employment team. It is worth considering the privilege guidelines when communicating with GitLab’s Legal and Corporate Affairs team (aka the LACA team), including the Legal Employment team. Note that, if a communication is privileged, it can be protected from disclosure in litigation or other disputes. If in doubt, there’s an internal, GitLab University micro course on ‘Privileged communication’ , which is relevant to any team member who communicates with the LACA team, seeking legal advice on behalf of GitLab. The training explains the legal protection which may be applied to certain communications between team members and LACA and how best to communicate in order to be protected. It is also important to note that, if you receive any formal documents that appear to be legal notices, demands, subpoenas, court papers, or other potential litigation materials, you should please forward these by email to the legal team immediately (to the ’ legal@gitlab.com ’ email address) without responding yourself. Please add a brief note explaining when and how you received the document. These materials often have strict response deadlines, and your prompt sharing allows the legal team to review and address them properly to protect both you and GitLab."

    "title": "Sustainability",
    "paragraph": "Corporate Sustainability is a business approach that enhances long term stakeholder value by implementing a strategy that considers every dimension of how a business operates when making social, environmental and economic progress. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance and refers to the three key factors when measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment in a business or company. At GitLab we use Sustainability and ESG interchangeably. Both terms are relevant to our work and both serve different purposes depending on the audience we interact with. The Sustainability Team creates and maintains GitLab’s Corporate Sustainability strategy and programs by driving and integrating responsible business practices and ESG regulatory compliance. The Sustainability team builds and maintains strong internal and external relationships to understand stakeholder expectations - including customer, investor and team members. This engagement allows us to remain customer centric and easy to do business with while meeting shareholder and team member expectations. The Sustainability Team has two primary functions and four corresponding programs: Compliance & Reporting : Manages customer and prospect ESG-related questionnaires, requests for proposals, and sustainability contractual clauses. Leads annual Sustainability report and external assurance process. Monitors global ESG regulation and works cross-functionally to advance GitLab’s culture of compliance with applicable ESG regulations. Responds to investor ESG rating agencies to maintain competitive ESG scoring among peers. Climate Action : Identifies and executes strategic climate programs, including annual measurement of GitLab’s greenhouse gas inventory, emissions reduction target-setting, partners with Procurement to run the sustainable supplier program, identifies emissions reduction opportunities across the business, and purchases high quality carbon credits. Manages team member & customer communications related to GitLab’s commitment to environmental sustainability. GiveLab : GiveLab is GitLab’s team member volunteer program and includes year-round volunteering, GiveLab 30 days of Impact, our annual company-wide volunteer campaign and GiveLab Champions Program. Volunteerism is an effective way to build trust through social connections - this leads to higher individual and team motivation, and greater cross-functional collaboration. GitLab for Non-Profits : GitLab’s in-kind donation program. Manages social impact communications with team members and customers, while developing strategic nonprofit partnerships to advance GitLab’s ESG goals and help enhance our brand reputation by demonstrating our commitment to the nonprofit community. Deeply integrated into our business philosophy, GitLab’s Sustainability strategy is driven by our values of Collaboration, Results for Customers, Efficiency, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, Iteration, and Transparency (CREDIT). GitLab’s stakeholders, including customers, investors, team members, and community members play a key role in GitLab’s Sustainability strategy. GitLab conducted its inaugural ESG materiality assessment in 2022. By conducting a materiality assessment with our stakeholders, we identified which ESG topics have the greatest impact on GitLab’s business and where we have the potential to have the greatest impact on the environment, society, and our global communities - those material topics drive the programs, policies and initiatives under our strategy. This page will continue to be updated as we make progress towards developing plans and programs to advance our Sustainability goals. The purpose of the advisory committee is to create cross-functional alignment on ESG objectives and decision making, to go beyond simply compliance and into long-term operational implementation. Members of the Sustainability Advisory Committee Like all functions at GitLab, transparency is a core focus. Every year GitLab publishes an annual sustainability report where we share our approach to managing our key sustainability focus areas, provide updates on programs and policies, achievements to date, metrics and targets, and plans for the future. The Sustainability team works cross-functionally to prepare GitLab for compliance with ESG regulations. The Sustainability team also supports internal teams with customer ESG questionnaires and RFPs. Customers and prospective customers are increasingly asking about GitLab’s Sustainability programs, including questions related to GitLab’s climate commitments and greenhouse gas emissions. Many of our customers are also subject to ESG regulation and we expect customer ESG questions to continue to increase as they look to better align to new regulations. GitLab is committed to doing our part to minimize our environmental footprint, including working to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our operations. GitLab’s stakeholders, including customers, investors, regulators, and team members expect the company to operate sustainably and to do our part to reduce our environmental footprint. Many of GitLab’s customers have GHG reduction targets and as a vendor, GitLab’s carbon emissions contribute to our customers’ emissions footprints. To remain easy to transact with, GitLab needs to meet the expectations of our customers by taking action on climate change. GitLab’s Climate Action Program consists of four pillars: Measure & Report: Every year GitLab conducts an annual greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory in alignment with the GHG Protocol, the global best practice carbon accounting standard. We publish the results of the inventory in our annual ESG report and have the data assured by a third-party. In 2026, GitLab is subject to new regulations in the US and the EU that will make these disclosures mandatory. Act: GitLab is taking action to reduce our carbon emissions. As a fully remote software company, the majority of our emissions come from our suppliers. Engaging our suppliers to measure their carbon emissions and set their own reduction targets is a critical component of our reduction pathway, which is why we have set an aspirational supplier engagement target. Please see the Sustainable Procurement Program for more information. The Sustainability team continues to explore other ways to reduce emissions and is doing further analysis on additional reduction pathways. Engage: This includes engaging GitLab team members in climate education and action. In 2024, we launched the GitLab Team Member Sustainability Guide , providing actionable steps team members can take at home to minimize their environmental impact. In FY26, we launched our partnership with Mammoth Climate , a climate literacy and challenges platform, to further engage team members with educational materials, activities, and rewards Accelerate: While GitLab works to reduce our emissions, we are also committed to accelerating climate solutions by purchasing high quality carbon credits to cover a portion of our carbon footprint. We are proud to partner with Rubicon Carbon to purchase a diversified portfolio of high quality carbon credits, financing carbon removal projects that meet Rubicon’s high standards of quality . In FY25, GitLab set an aspirational science-aligned supplier engagement target to reduce our Scope 3 emissions: 70% of our suppliers (by emissions) will have science-aligned climate targets by FY29. Our sustainable procurement program includes the following initiatives: We look forward to sharing updates on this new initiative. The Green DevOps Working Group at GitLab aims to embed sustainability throughout the software development lifecycle to reduce environmental impact while unlocking operational and business value. Its core objectives include lowering carbon emissions and energy use, integrating green practices into business processes, enhancing customer capabilities to meet regulatory and sustainability goals, and positioning GitLab as a leader in sustainable DevOps and green software. Workstreams address areas such as cloud sustainability, CI/CD energy consumption tracking and reduction, community innovation and engagement, sustainable AI and procurement, and reporting. Each workstream is led by the Sustainability team and the relevant functional team member. Customers who are interested in providing insights and feedback on sustainability features are encouraged to contact the Sustainability Team at esg@gitlab.com for more information. At GitLab, all team members do work that supports the company, which supports the enhancement of an open source codebase. This codebase is freely available to everyone to make better software faster and drive progress through what they build. Between 2022 and 2024, team members made over 125,000 commits to the open source part of the GitLab codebase. But, there are also other ways to give back and many team members choose to contribute beyond GitLab. In addition to contributing to GitLab, GitLab offers additional optional pathways for team members to give back while leveraging their unique skills and passions through programs such as GiveLab, GitLab’s Team Member Volunteer Program. GitLab encourages team members to take part in volunteer initiatives such as supporting their local communities, participating in virtual volunteer activities, and organizing volunteer activities as part of team events. Corporate volunteerism has been proven to be an effective strategy for boosting engagement , improving employee retention, and strengthening relationships at work . Volunteering with GiveLab supports team members in fostering connections, building trust among one another and embodying our CREDIT values while positively impacting our communities. Team members may self organize volunteer events at any point throughout the year. To submit a request for a team volunteer activity with a Registered Nonprofit Organization that isn’t on the current GiveLab Nonprofit Directory , please go to the Philanthropic Requests epic and open a new issue using the Volunteer_Support Template . Team members can also request support from the Sustainability Team to organize local or virtual volunteer opportunities on their behalf by going to the Philanthropic Requests epic and opening a new issue using the Volunteer_Support Template . Please write “yes” for the question, “Would you like the Sustainability team’s help organizing the volunteer activity?” All team members and volunteer activities must adhere to the GitLab Philanthropy Policy . Team members must follow GitLab’s paid time off (PTO) policy if volunteering during work hours and use the “public service/volunteer” option in Workday. If volunteering in person, team members may incur some expenses. Team members can expense up to a total of $25 per volunteer event for expenses incurred that meet the allowed for reimbursement criteria. All expenses should be submitted in Navan using the “GiveLab” classification. Please note that GitLab does not allow team members to travel to in-person volunteer events. All in-person volunteering should be local to the team member. As with all company expenses , team members must be thoughtful in spending the company’s money and use best judgment to ensure that all expenses are deemed “ordinary and necessary.” Team members should follow all team member expense responsibilities . Expenses allowed for reimbursement (for in-person volunteer events): Expenses not allowed for reimbursement: As with our unique ways of working, GitLab and its team members have identified and sought out opportunities for impact that speak not only to our values but also to our all-remote nature. To review previous opportunities that team members participated in, visit the historical activities page . GiveLab 30 Days of Impact is GitLab’s annual volunteer campaign created to encourage team members to foster connections, build trust among one another and embody our CREDIT values while positively impacting our communities. We have designed this program with our high-performing team culture and results for customers in mind. GiveLab 30 days of Impact runs annually in Q4 and our goal is to encourage as many team members as possible to volunteer over the course of 30 days. Throughout the month, team members can volunteer as little as one hour of their time to make an impact. We understand that our team members are driven by many different factors, and we welcome that volunteer participation will look different for everyone. Through GiveLab 30 days of Impact we aim to offer many different ways for team members to get involved such as: While GitLab encourages year-round volunteerism through GiveLab , GiveLab 30 days of Impact centralizes our efforts into an annual campaign to have a larger collective impact over a specific timeframe. Corporate volunteerism has been proven to be an effective strategy for boosting engagement , improving employee retention, and strengthening relationships at work . Additionally, this program offers volunteering opportunities around a major holiday season in many parts of the world, a time when many are seeking opportunities to give back. Team member participation is voluntary, should not interfere with work commitments, and time off is required to be in alignment with GitLab’s PTO policy . Travel is not permitted for this program. Team Members may choose to volunteer virtually or through local in-person events. Volunteer events typically last between one and four hours. Managers play an important role in supporting team members in taking time for themselves and their families, while also ensuring accountability to results and coverage for teams and its goals. Our Results for Customers value sits at the top of our values hierarchy, and our PTO policy empowers managers to appropriately manage workloads and deliverables, while also giving team members the time away they need from work. Team Members taking time off to volunteer should communicate time off in advance with their manager. To request volunteer time off, follow the Paid Time Off procedures outlined in our handbook and reach out to People Operations via HelpLab should you have any concerns. A step-by-step guide on how to request paid time off can be found here . Note that volunteer time off should be used towards acceptable volunteer activities and in adherence with our GitLab Philanthropy Policy . Please see our GiveLab reimbursement policy to understand current allowances as they relate to volunteering costs. We have created an internal GiveLab Volunteer Directory that features a list of vetted nonprofit organizations with available volunteer opportunities. Team members can search the document for virtual volunteer opportunities, opportunities to volunteer with GitLab Foundation grantees and search for local opportunities. We encourage all team members to contribute to our GiveLab Volunteer Directory. To recommend a nonprofit organization to add to the Directory, please open a Volunteer Recommendation Issue . The GiveLab Champions are team members who are passionate about giving back to their communities and want to encourage other team members to do the same. GiveLab Champions self-identify to participate in the voluntary Champions group, managed by the Sustainability team. The GiveLab Champions help activate the GiveLab signature program, but also work to organize and promote volunteer opportunities year-round. GiveLab Champions help team members build trust through social connections, build connections within their communities, and help GitLab provide meaningful opportunities for team members to give back. The GiveLab Champions ensure global voices are heard and relevant causes are represented based on where team members live. GiveLab Champions help to make GitLab a better place to work. The time commitment for a GiveLab Champion is estimated to be 3-5 hours per quarter. Participation can vary throughout the year. GitLab launched GitLab for Nonprofits , an in-kind donation program in 2023. Through this program, GitLab supports Registered 501c3 (or jurisdictional equivalent) Nonprofit Organizations in good standing that align with our values by offering free licenses and seats. The program operates on a first come first served basis. Once the annual donation of 5,000 seats is met, the application will remain closed for the year. What are the benefits of the GitLab for Nonprofits program? GitLab is a single platform for project management, collaboration, source control management, git, automation, security, and much more. Because it is easy to use, flexible, and all in one place, it is the best choice for nonprofits to scale their work. The GitLab for Nonprofits Program gives free licenses of GitLab to registered nonprofit organizations. Nonprofits accepted into the program will be provided a free Ultimate license for one year (SaaS or self-managed) for up to 20 seats. Additional seats may be requested although they may not be granted. Who qualifies for the program? GitLab supports Registered 501c3 (or jurisdictional equivalent) Nonprofit Organizations in good standing that align with our Values . A “Registered Nonprofit Organization” is one that has been registered with the local government or authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal or national government. For the calendar year 2024, we will limit the in-kind program to 5,000 seats, which was approved by finance and the board in the Philanthropy Policy . Each organization will be eligible for up to 20 seats. This will allow us to assist as many organizations as possible. This will be revisited throughout the year and adjusted as needed. Interested organizations who are new customers may request additional seats although the request may not be granted. To limit churn, current GitLab customers that apply to transition to the Nonprofit Program will not be granted a special request above the 20 seats. What are the terms of the GitLab for Nonprofits program? Upon acceptance, program members are subject to the GitLab Subscription Agreement . The decision to issue a GitLab for Nonprofits license is always at the sole discretion of GitLab. Interested organizations need to visit the GitLab for Nonprofits page and submit the application form . How are applications processed? Nonprofits apply on the GitLab for Nonprofits page. Once the application is submitted, the Nonprofit will receive a message and a link to TechSoup, our verification partner. The Nonprofit will then need to log in or create their TechSoup account. TechSoup provides a rigorous vetting process to ensure the nonprofit is eligible for the GitLab for Nonprofits program and meets all requirements. If a Nonprofit is verified, TechSoup will notify GitLab. GitLab will then undergo its own vetting and approval process. Once all parties have verified and approved the Nonprofit, GitLab will send the instructions directly to the Nonprofit to redeem their license. If a Nonprofit is not verified through TechSoup, TechSoup will provide details on how the Nonprofit can become verified. If a Nonprofit is declined from GitLab, GitLab will notify the Nonprofit via nonprofits@GitLab.com . Please allow up to 15 business days for the application and verification process. Must Nonprofits renew their memberships? Yes. All nonprofits must renew their membership annually, which involves a re-verification process. Nonprofits will submit for renewal the same way they first applied for the program. Where can members receive support? While GitLab for Nonprofits Program benefits do not include product support , program members can receive help with GitLab in a number of ways. In general, we recommend the following: I’m a GitLab Team Member and I have a customer applying for the program. What do I do?

    "title": "GitLab Privacy",
    "paragraph": "The Privacy Team is part of the Legal and Corporate Affairs Team. We provide support and guidance to uphold consistent business processes around the protection of personal data as it relates to GitLab customers, users, Team Members, and other natural persons. We collaborate cross-functionally and serve as advocates to ensure that the data privacy practices of GitLab meet the needs of our cross-functional partners and are continually balanced with an ever-changing global data privacy and protection landscape. Slack channel - #legal is the best place for questions relating to our team that do not require legal advice, deliverables, or any discussion of confidential information. For issues that require action from the Privacy Team, apply the label Privacy::Intake . This will update the Privacy Legal Issue Board and allow the team to triage the issue appropriately. We also use the following labels: For sensitive, private, or confidential requests email legal_internal@gitlab.com . Please do not send emails to this address for engineering, marketing, sales or procurement requests. These should be directed to #legal or an issue should be created in the Legal and Compliance project. Tell people what you are doing with personal data and why you are doing it so that the person can make an informed decision about whether they want to allow it to happen. Do not be creepy about what personal data is collected or how it is used and do not change the way personal data is used without first giving people notice and an opportunity to object, or, where required, obtaining prior consent. Make it easy for people to tell us their privacy preferences and honor those preferences even if they change over time. Build a product or service that has privacy-focused settings turned on by default and let the consumer decide if and when they want to change that. Transparency is a core value and every team member is responsible for the proper collection and use of personal data consistent with our Privacy Statement . Anonymization The process of permanently and irreversibly altering personal data in a way that it is no longer capable of being related back to a specific individual. Consent A freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of an individual’s wishes. Consent is captured by an un-ticked checkbox or other unequivocal statement which signifies agreement to the processing of personal data before or at the time of collection. Data Classification A method of determining types of data associated by risk. See GitLab Security Data Classification Standards for more information. Data Controller A natural or legal person, agency, or other entity which alone, or jointly with others, determines the purpose and means of processing personal data. For example, GitLab is a Data Controller is in the areas of marketing and sales where the personal data of prospects and leads is managed solely at our discretion. GitLab also serves as a Data Controller for all personal data collected from Team Members for employment purposes and any administration of benefits. Data Processor A natural or legal person, agency, or other entity which processes personal data on behalf of a Data Controller. GitLab acts as a Data Processor when we manage personal data native to a Customer’s instance or namespace. GitLab acts as a Processor in these situations because the Customer is the ultimate owner of the data it submits to the service offerings, and our contracts service as Customer’s instructions to GitLab regarding the processing of their data. Data Subject An identified or identifiable natural person. Data Subject Rights Rights granted to individuals in relation to personal data or information processed about them. Because Data Subjct Rights are instrumental to the privacy and protection of data subjects, many of these rights are codified under global privacy legislation, such as the GDPR, CCPA, and LGDP. If a business processes personal data pursuant to certain bases such as consent or legitimate interest, then a data subject may assert one of its fundamental rights and a business is obligated to respond under law. The rights granted vary slightly by country, region, province or state. GitLab treats all users and Team Members the same and will respond to a data subject request from any individual user or team member even if they live in a country, region, or state/province without specific data protection laws. Expand the following section for more information about the data subject rights available. Right of Access A request seeking access to the specific pieces of personal data that have been collected and used by a Data Controller. Right to Correct A request asking for inaccurate or incomplete personal data to be corrected. Right to Delete A request which seeks the erasure of personal data relating to the data subject. Deletion requests must meet certain conditions and businesses are not required to delete any personal data that is processed to meet legal obligations, including that data which may be processed in pursuit or in defense of claims. Right to Portability A request where the data subject wants to transfer their data to another Data Controller; typically seen when the individual changes service providers that share a compatible electronic filing system. Right to Restrict Processing This is a request for the Data Controller to stop processing personal data under certain circumstances. This may also include a request to limit the use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Data. Right to Object A request to opt-out of all data processing or specific processing of personal data based on consent or legitimate interest. Generally this is a request to opt-out of processing for targeted advertising, which includes the sale or sharing of personal data for profiling or cross-context behavioral advertising. Right Not to be Subject to Fully Automated Decisions This is a request that the data subject not be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which would have a significant legal impact. An example might be an algorithm that excludes someone of a certain race from obtaining a credit card. DPIA A Data Protection Impact Assessment is a method to review and document identified privacy compliance risks, as well as evalute higher risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals, including any that pose potential for significant harm. Learn more about GitLab’s process for completing DPIAs here . Personal Data Any data, individually or when combined with other data, that identifies, relates to, describes or is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an identifiable natural person (a ‘data subject’), whether directly or indirectly. See also, Sensitive Personal Data. Privacy by Default A concept that should be implemented at the product development stage and uses appropriate measures to ensure that, by default, the only personal data processed is what is truly necessary. In practice, this means a user’s privacy settings prioritize privacy in their default state. Privacy by Design A concept which focuses on intentionally designing a product that incorporates foundational privacy principles and ensures that Controllers and Processors are able to fulfill data protection obligations. This may include appropriate technical and organizational measures such as pseudonymisation and encryption. Pseudonymization The process of altering personal data so that it can no longer be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional re-identifying information. In order to practice successful Pseudonymization, the re-identifying information should be kept separate from the pseudonymized data. Publicly Available Personal Data Refers to personal data that is publicly available from federal, state, or local government records or made manifestly public by the data subject. Under limited data privacy laws this may also include personal data made public through widely distributed media. Sensitive Personal Data Data that is particularly personal and intimately tied to the core identity of a person. This type of data generally includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data related to health, data related to sex life or sexual orientation, criminal offenses, and citizenship/immigraion status. In some jurisdictions, Sensitive Personal Data includes government identifiers and financial data. Every vendor that handles personal data is required to go through a Privacy Review prior to being onboarded, which includes completion and approval of the privacy due diligence questionnaires detailed in the Procurement process . Certain vendors who are classified as handling red or orange data under our Data Classification Standards are reviewed annually. Additionally, when new product features are designed, there are times when a formal privacy review is required. This section outlines the process for these reviews. For Third-Party Risk Acceptance, any Moderate/High risk requires VP and/or above approval Anytime a new feature or a change to an existing feature is planned, Product Managers and Engineering Managers should evaluate if the planned development presents a legal risk where personal data is involved. If Personal Data is implicated, utilize the Legal Risk Checklist and Workflow ( internal only ) GitLab Team Members are required to complete annual training which covers general privacy practices worldwide. The goal of annual training is to ensure that Team Members understand what personal data is and how to handle it to ensure that GitLab maintains the trust our customers have placed in us as well as to ensure that GitLab remains compliant with frequently changing legal and regulatory obligations."

    "title": "Risk Management and Dispute Resolution (RMDR)",
    "paragraph": "The Risk Management and Dispute Resolution (RMDR) division of GitLab Legal and Corporate Affairs (LACA) is responsible for informing and guiding GitLab’s risk management strategies as well as managing internal and external investigations, litigation and other dispute resolution. We seek to support resolution across a wide range of topics, including responding to subpoenas and discovery requests, drafting and revising legal documentation, managing investigations and negotiating and drafting agreements. It is our goal to proactively address and resolve these matters in support of GitLab’s business objectives, coordinating with internal business partners across the company whenever appropriate. In support of these goals, we adopt this mantra: if you see something, say something! There are times when GitLab team members must immediately consult with RMDR to ensure that GitLab is managing its legal risks effectively. These include: If in doubt, please involve RMDR earlier rather than later – we would always rather be proactive than reactive. You can reach out to RMDR via rmdr@gitlab.com . Privileged communication is communication, written or oral, that is protected from later disclosure in litigation because it was conveyed to the attorney in confidence by a client for the purpose of seeking legal advice or by an attorney for the purpose of giving legal advice . Privilege can also be asserted over certain confidential documents created by attorneys for the same purpose. The terminology differs depending on the jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, the privilege is generally referred to as “attorney-client privilege” for communications made to or from an attorney for the purpose of providing legal advice or “attorney work product” for communication or documentations created in relation to actual or anticipated litigation. In many of our EMEA and APAC countries, it may be called “client legal privilege,” “legal professional privilege,” “legal advice privilege,” or “litigation privilege.” Additionally, the scope of the privilege differs by country. It is therefore likely that the status of a privileged communication that contains legal advice in respect of foreign law will be determined by reference to the law of the country in which any action is taken. If you have jurisdiction-specific questions about privilege, please contact a LACA team member who sits in that jurisdiction. Practically speaking, this means that communications between our team members and members of LACA are not necessarily privileged just because a member of the LACA team is involved. As a threshold matter, the LACA team consists of both attorneys and non-attorneys. Communications may be privileged if the person wishing to assert the privilege can establish that the communication was made to an attorney of the LACA team and the dominant purpose of the communication was to seek legal advice. Conversely, if the dominant purpose of the communication - even if made to an attorney - is simply to seek business advice, it is very unlikely to be privileged. Additionally, otherwise privileged communication will lose its privilege in most circumstances if it is further or also disclosed to third parties. Thus, team members should always be aware of who has access to the communication and should be very careful about forwarding it. What are some tips for team members to follow to help maintain privileged communication? Below are the steps you can take to help ensure that any communications you have with GitLab’s LACA team can be considered privileged: For more information, please see the internal handbook here . A legal hold is the process GitLab uses to preserve all forms of relevant evidence, whether it be emails, instant messages, physical documents, handwritten or typed notes, voicemails, raw data, backup tapes, and any other type of information that could be relevant to an investigation, pending or imminent litigation or when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Legal holds are imperative in preventing spoliation (destruction, deletion, or alteration) of evidence which can have a severely negative impact on a company’s case, including leading to sanctions. Once GitLab becomes aware of an investigation or potential litigation, a GitLab attorney will provide notice to the impacted team members, instructing them not to delete or destroy any information relating to the subject matter of the investigation or potential litigation. The legal hold applies to paper and electronic documents. During a legal hold, all retention policies must be overridden. Your obligation to follow the procedures outlined in the notice continues until the hold is lifted, even if you depart the Company. If you depart the Company, all Company owned devices and any material you are holding in accordance with any active Legal Hold Notice or active Company investigation should be turned over upon your departure."

    "title": "Trade Compliance",
    "paragraph": "Trade control laws, which often consist of sanctions, export controls, and import laws, govern how and under what circumstances technology, software, and technical assistance may be exported. Trade control laws vary from country to country but usually exist to protect national security and further foreign policy and economic interests. Under United States law, exports, re-exports, and transfers, can take many forms, including oral, written, and visual disclosure, physical shipment, and electronic transfer or transmission. An export can also occur when technology, software, or technical assistance is transmitted to U.S. nationals abroad, or to non-U.S. nationals located within the United States. The export of certain software, technology, or technical assistance to certain countries, certain end users, or for certain end uses, may require authorization from the United States government prior to export, re-export, or transfer. GitLab Enterprise Edition, related technology, and services (collectively, “GitLab Software”), are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), and various sanctions programs administered by the U.S Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The GitLab Community Edition is freely available to the public and is not subject to the EAR. GitLab continuosly monitors developments to these regulations to maintain compliance and to leverage any opportunity to broaden access to GitLab in a compliant manner that allows everyone to contribute. The GitLab Software has been classified via CCATS G178430 as a 5D992.c mass market encryption product with eligibility for export to most destinations under 15 CFR 740.17(b)(1) of license exception ENC. GitLab users may not export, re-export, or transfer GitLab Software, without first obtaining authorization from the U.S. government, to (a) any U.S. embargoed country including but not limited to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, Belarus, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, (b) any party identified on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person list or the Department of Commerce Denied Persons, Entity, or Unverified lists, or (c) for end use involving sensitive nuclear, rocket systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, missiles, chemical or biological weapons, or for any other end use prohibited by 15 CFR 744. GitLab provides this information, which is subject to change without notice, to facilitate GitLab users’ compliance with applicable trade control law. GitLab users remain solely responsible for exporting, re-exporting, and transferring GitLab Software and any user-developed content in accordance with those regulations and should seek legal counsel as necessary."
