    "title": "GitLab Mission",
    "paragraph": "It is GitLab’s mission to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world . There are three ways you can contribute and co-create: To ensure that everyone can contribute with GitLab we allow anyone to create a proposal, at any time, without setup, and with confidence. Let’s analyze that sentence a bit. We actively welcome contributors to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create with GitLab, the application . When everyone can contribute and co-create , users become contributors and we greatly increase the rate of innovation to benefit customers and users. There is also an open dialogue between GitLab and our customers, partners, and the community so that we can also better identify what they need. That way we can not only build a solution for them, but bring that solution to the world. We think that it is logical that our collaboration tools are a collaborative work themselves. More than 3,000 people from the wider community have contributed to GitLab to make that a reality. We do this by having quality code, tests, documentation, popular frameworks, and offering a comprehensive GitLab Development Kit and a dedicated GitLab Design System . We use GitLab at GitLab Inc., we dogfood it and make it a tool we continue to love. We celebrate contributions by recognizing a Most Valuable Person (MVP) every month. We allow everyone to anticipate, propose, discuss, and contribute features by having everything on a public issue tracker. We ship a new version every month so contributions and feedback are visible fast. To contribute to open source software, people must be empowered to learn programming. That is why we sponsor initiatives such as Rails Girls. There are a few significant, but often overlooked, nuances of the enabling everyone to contribute to GitLab, the application mantra: A group discussion reiterating the importance of everyone being able to contribute: To enable everyone to contribute to GitLab, the company we have open business processes. This allows all team members to suggest improvements to our handbook. We hire remotely so our team members can be judged on results, not presence in an office. We engage on social media platforms and in our blog post comments. And we strive to take decisions guided by our values . We welcome all contributors in the www-gitlab-com project so that everyone can contribute to about.gitlab.com . GitLab uses about.gitlab.com to share our expertise with the world and believe we can build even greater levels of trust with contributions from our team and community. We strive to provide a great experience for our existing and new community members by reviewing changes and integrating the contributions into our regularly planned updates. Our Mission is on a 30 year cadence . Our purpose is to help people increase their lifetime earnings through training, access to opportunities, and the DevSecOps platform. Our mission is the way we realize our purpose . By enabling everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world , we increase access for people to be creators. With more contributors and more creators, we increase both the volume and velocity of innovation. More innovation drives economic progress that benefits consumers, businesses, and the economy as a whole . As a result, innovation both directly and indirectly increases the total volume of available opportunities and average value of each individual opportunity. Access to a broader set of more valuable opportunities ultimately increases people’s lifetime earnings . Our purpose is on the same 30 year cadence as our mission. Our purpose informs our mission, which directly or indirectly informs the rest of the items in our cadence . As a result, progress for the items on our cadence page creates progress for both our mission and our purpose . Our mission is the inspiration for our vision . Our vision is on a 10 year cadence. Our mission guides our path, and our values are the principles we live along this path. We firmly adhere to laws including trade compliance laws – see the GitLab Code of Business Conduct and Ethics , in countries where we do business, and welcome everyone abiding by those legal restrictions to be customers of GitLab. In some circumstances, we may opt to not work with particular organizations, on a case-by-case basis. Some reasons we may choose not to work with certain entities include, but are not limited to: This policy is in alignment with our mission, contributor and employee code-of-conduct and company values. Here are some links that may give you some background at how we arrived at this customer acceptance policy: We acknowledge the concerns to achieving our goals. We document them in our Mitigating Concerns page . See what your team could do with The DevSecOps Platform. Have a question? We're here to help."

    "title": "GitLab Values",
    "paragraph": "GitLab’s six core values are Collaboration , Results for Customers , ⏱️ Efficiency , Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging , Iteration , and ️ Transparency , and together they spell the CREDIT we give each other by assuming good intent. We react to them with values emoji and they are made actionable below. We take inspiration from other companies, and we always go for the boring solutions . Our co-founder, Sid Sijbrandij, has shared the origin of each of the CREDIT values, but just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better. GitLab values are a living document. In many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned (and scars earned) in the course of doing business. We used to have more values, but it was difficult to remember them all. In response, we condensed them, created an acronym (CREDIT), and listed operating principles to guide behavior. Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements. Please assign MRs to update these values to our Chief People Officer and if you work at GitLab, also @mention them in the #values Slack channel . Driving Results with CREDIT from GitLab on Vimeo . To achieve results, team members must work together effectively. At GitLab, helping others is a priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that you are trying to achieve. Similarly, you can rely on others for help and advice—in fact, you’re expected to do so. Anyone can chime in on any subject, including people who don’t work at GitLab. The person who’s responsible for the work decides how to do it, but they should always take each suggestion seriously and try to respond and explain why it may or may not have been implemented. We value caring for others. Demonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback. Kindness doesn’t mean holding back on feedback or avoiding disagreements, these are crucial to professional growth and getting results for customers. Kindness means you make a separation between the work and the person, you can criticize someone’s work but still be respectful to the person. Give as much positive feedback as you can, and do it in a public way. There are aspects of GitLab culture, such as intentional transparency, that are unintuitive to outsiders and new team members. Be willing to invest in people and engage in open dialogue. For example, consider making private issues public wherever possible so that we can all learn from the experience. Don’t be afraid of judgement or scrutiny when sharing publicly, we all understand it’s impossible to know everything . Everyone can remind anyone in the company about our values. If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions. Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and speak up . Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible. One-on-one video calls are preferred. Negative feedback is distinct from negativity and disagreement. If there is no direct feedback involved, strive to discuss disagreement in a public channel , respectfully and transparently . In a GitLab Unfiltered interview on values , GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context. We deal with negative all the time at GitLab. If it’s not a problem, then why are we discussing it? We deal with negativity a lot, and that’s also part of our ambition. If you want to get better, you talk about what you can improve. We’re allowed to publicly discuss negative things; we’re not allowed to give negative feedback in a large setting if it could be feasibly administered in a smaller setting. Negative feedback can be given in a group setting if it’s to someone higher in the management chain. This shows that no one is above feedback. We want to solve problems while they are small . If you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer), please voice your concerns rather than keeping them to yourself. If you need to escalate beyond your manager, you could consider speaking to your skip-level , a more senior person, or a people business partner . Recognize the people that helped you publicly, for example in our #thanks chat channel . When publicly thanking, it’s important to recognize the following: Giving feedback is challenging, but it’s important to deliver it effectively. When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself; focus on the business impact and not the person. Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example. If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account. An example of giving positive feedback is our thanks chat channel . For managers, it’s important to realize that team members react to a negative incident with their managers six times more strongly than they do to a positive one. Keeping that in mind, if an error is so inconsequential that the value gained from providing criticism is low, it might make sense to keep that feedback to yourself. In the situations where negative feedback must be given, focus on the purpose for that feedback: to improve the team member’s performance going forward. Give recognition generously, in the open, and often to generate more engagement from your team. We use a lot of text-based communication , and if you know the person behind the text, it will be easier to prevent conflicts. So we encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level through informal communication , for example, virtual coffee chats , and during GitLab Summit . While it’s wise to seek advice from experts within your function, we encourage GitLab team members to do the same across departments. This enables the company to iterate more quickly, embrace the understanding that everyone can contribute and include more diverse perspectives when possible. If you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company, you’re doing something wrong. People already know our decision-making process . Explain why you’re making the decision, and respect everyone irrespective of their function. This includes using the rank of another person - including the CEO - to sell an idea or decision. We naturally have a double standard when it comes to the actions of others. We blame circumstances for our own mistakes, but individuals for theirs. This double standard is called the Fundamental Attribution Error . In order to mitigate this bias, you should always assume positive intent in your interactions with others, respecting their expertise and giving them grace in the face of what you might perceive as mistakes. When disagreeing , folks sometimes argue against the weakest points of an argument, or an imaginary argument (e.g. “straw man” ). Assume the points are presented in good faith, and instead try to argue against the strongest version of your opponent’s position. We call this arguing against a “steel” position, instead of a “straw” one. This concept is borrowed from argue the “steel man” technique. A “steel” position should be against the absolute most effective version of your opponent’s position — potentially even more compelling than the one they presented. A good “steel” position is one where the other person feels you’ve represented their position well, even if they still disagree with your assumptions or conclusion. There is a lot of good in this article about not wanting jerks on our team, but we believe that jerk is a label for behavior rather than an inherent classification of a person. We avoid classifications. If you made a mistake, apologize as soon as possible. Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength. The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes. Additionally, when we share our mistakes and bring attention to them, others can learn from us, and the same mistake is less likely to be repeated by someone else. Mistakes can include when you have not been kind to someone. In order to reinforce our values, it is important, and takes more courage, to apologize publicly when you have been unkind publicly (e.g., when you have said something unkind or unprofessional to an individual or group in a Slack channel). Don’t defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake. You are not your work; you don’t have to defend your point. You do have to search for the right answer with help from others. In a GitLab Unfiltered interview , GitLab Head of Remote Darren M. adds context on this operating principle. In many organizations, there’s a subtle, low-level, persistent pressure to continually prove your worth. And I believe that this fuels imposter syndrome and wreaks havoc on mental health . What’s so troubling to me is how often perception is reality. In other words, those who have mastered the art of being perceived as elite reap benefits, though this has nothing to do with actual results. At GitLab, “no ego” means that we foster and support an environment where results matter, and you’re given agency to approach your work in the way that makes sense to you. Instead of judging people for not approaching work in an agreed-upon way, “no ego” encourages people to glean inspiration from watching others approach work in new and different ways. A candidate who has talked to a lot of people inside GitLab said that, compared to other companies, one thing stood out the most: everyone here mentioned wanting to see each other succeed. Keep an eye out for others who may be struggling or stuck. If you see someone who needs help, reach out and assist. This might involve offering to pair program or setting up a sync brainstorming session. The goal is to connect them with someone else who can provide expertise or assistance. We are a team, so we succeed and shine together by supporting each other! Always make suggestions about examples of work, not the person. Say “You didn’t respond to my feedback about the design” instead of “You never listen”. And, when receiving feedback, keep in mind that feedback is the best way to improve, and that others giving you feedback want to see you succeed. Our collaboration value is about helping each other when we have questions, need critique, or need help. No need to brainstorm, wait for consensus, or do with two what you can do yourself . The Bolt Handbook refers to this as the Founder Mentality , where all team members should approach the problem as if they own the company. Investigate mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure’s mechanism and the decision-making process that led to the failure, rather than cast blame on a person or team. We hold blameless root cause analyses and retrospectives for stakeholders to speak up without fear of punishment or retribution. People joining the company frequently say, “I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes.” At GitLab, we should be more accepting of people taking initiative in trying to improve things. As companies grow, their speed of decision-making goes down since there are more people involved. We should counteract that by having short toes and feeling comfortable letting others contribute to our domain. For example, pointed, respectful feedback to a proposal by GitLab’s CEO led to their own merge request being closed. However, it is not required to respond to comments. We know we must rely on others for the expertise they have that we don’t. It’s OK to admit you don’t know something and to ask for help, even if doing so makes you feel vulnerable. It is never too late to ask a question, and by doing so, you can get the information you need to produce results and to strengthen your own skills as well as GitLab as a whole. After your question is answered, please document the answer so that it can be shared . Don’t display surprise when people say they don’t know something, as it is important that everyone feels comfortable saying “I don’t know” and “I don’t understand.” (As inspired by Recurse .) When collaborating, it is always important to stay above radar and work transparently , but collaboration is not consensus and disagreement is part of collaboration. You don’t need to ask people for their input, and they shouldn’t ask you “Why didn’t you ask me?”. You don’t have to wait for people to provide input, if you did ask them. You don’t need to have everyone agreeing to the same thing - they can disagree, commit, and advocate . Two-way doors decisions can be reversed as part of disagree, commit, and advocate , while one-way door decisions benefit from more input. Recognize these reversible two-way door decisions for when less input is required to iterate faster. We believe in permissionless innovation — you don’t need to involve people, but everyone can contribute. This is core to how we iterate , since we want smaller teams moving quickly rather than large teams achieving consensus slowly. Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate collaboration when we take action to help others and include other’s (both internal and external) input (both help and feedback) to achieve the best possible outcome. We exist to help our customers achieve more. Everything we do should be in service of making our customers successful with GitLab. Results for Customers is at the top of our values hierarchy, as our customers achieving results drives overall business performance that enables everything else. The Results for Customers value is displayed through the following operating principles: While we iterate with small changes, we strive for large, ambitious results. We have an ambitious mission and vision , and we aim to be the best in the world across all our functions. Setting ambitious, measurable goals enables us to best deliver customer results. We agree in writing on measurable goals. We have and report against KPIs with guiding targets. All GitLab team members should understand our customers’ needs, issues, and value propositions. We understand how they use GitLab and what they need from a platform in order to meet their goals. Internally facing teams consider the impact of their work as it pertains indirectly to GitLab’s customers. We better understand customers and their needs through: We create together with our customers. There is an open dialogue between GitLab and our customers so that we can better identify what they need. As a result of building a solution for them, we can also bring that solution to the world. Our focus is to increase customer results. At GitLab, one way to drive customer results is through platform enhancements that drive the most value for direct users. This requires being aware of the Concur effect . Arvind Narayanan , a Princeton Professor, described their frustration with Blackboard in a viral Tweet: It has every feature ever dreamed up. But like anything designed by a committee, the interface is incoherent and any task requires at least fifteen clicks (and that’s if you even remember the correct sequence the first time). Software companies can be breathtakingly clueless when there’s a layer of indirection between them and their users. Everyone who’s suffered through Blackboard will have the same reaction to this: try having less functionality! Ryan Falor followed up on Narayanan’s tweet with their definition of the Concur Effect: See the Hacker News discussion for a specific UX example. At GitLab, we want to drive customer results through focusing on platform enhancements that drive the most value for direct users. Customer results are more important than: We care about what you achieve: the code you shipped, the needle you moved, the user you made happy, and the team member you helped. Someone who took the afternoon off shouldn’t feel like they did something wrong, unless it negatively impacted a goal or result they were responsible for. You don’t have to defend how you spend your day if you are performing and delivering against expectations. We trust team members to do the right thing instead of having rigid rules. We trust team members to show up and do their best work. Do not incite competition by proclaiming how many hours you worked yesterday. If you are working too many hours, talk to your manager to discuss solutions. We use our own product in the way our users do to surface improvements that will lead to better customer results . GitLab is a DevSecOps Platform that can be used by people throughout the business. This is how we use it within GitLab. For example, we use our OKR functionality company-wide to inform product enhancements and for team members to have a great understanding of the customer experience. We also dogfood in the following ways: When something breaks, doesn’t work well, or needs improvement, we are more likely to notice it internally and address it before it impacts our larger community. We give people agency to focus on what they think is most beneficial. If a meeting doesn’t seem interesting and someone’s active participation is not critical to the outcome of the meeting, they can always opt to not attend, or during a video call they can work on other things if they want. Staying in the call may still make sense even if you are working on other tasks, so other peers can ping you and get fast answers when needed. This is particularly useful in multi-purpose meetings where you may be involved for just a few minutes. Challenging the status quo can lead to remarkable results - we must never stop. A challenger mindset requires that we continually ask ourselves bold, difficult questions about our business and the problems we solve, while resisting complacency. To succeed we must innovate and delight our customers with the value of the products we build. A challenger mindset requires a relentless pursuit of excellence - we must be tenacious . Each win for our customers builds reputational capital we can use to earn the trust of prospects in a competitive market. While competition is a feature of capitalism, internally as GitLab team members, we must focus our efforts inwardly on achieving our very best results for customers to win market share. You don’t always get results and this will lead to criticism from yourself and/or others. We believe our talents can be developed through hard work, targeted training, learning from others, on-the-job experience, and receiving input from others. It is in our DNA as a company and individuals to look for opportunity, stay humble, and never settle. We try to hire people based on their trajectory, not their pedigree . We also strive to foster a culture of curiosity and continuous learning where team members are provided and proactively seek out opportunities to grow themselves and their careers. We believe that with the right expectations and direction, people can grow to take on new challenges and surpass expectations. Our definition of cross-functional optimization is that you do what is best for the organization as a whole. Don’t optimize for the goals of your team when it negatively impacts the goals of other teams, our users, and/or the company. Those goals are also your problem and your job. For example, you may have set a non-urgent functional milestone that is supposed to land at the end of the quarter. If delivering within the last week requires engagement from the GTM teams , the right decision may be to push your own team’s target by a week to reduce the ask for the GTM team as the GTM focuses on meeting its revenue objectives. In the context of collaboration , if anyone is blocked by you on a question, your approval, or a merge request review, you should prioritize unblocking them, either directly or through helping them find someone else who can. We refer to this as “persistence of purpose”. As talked about in The Influence Blog , tenacity is the ability to display commitment to what you believe in. You keep picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and quickly get going again having learned a little more. We value the ability to maintain focus and motivation when work is tough and asking for help when needed. We expect team members to complete tasks that they are assigned. You are responsible for executing with attention to detail, connecting the dots across the organization and anticipating and solving problems. As an owner, you are responsible for overcoming challenges, not suppliers or other team members. Take initiative and proactively inform stakeholders when there is something you might not be able to solve. Time gained or lost has compounding effects. Try to get the results as fast as possible, but without compromising our other values and ways we communicate , so the compounding of results can begin and we can focus on the next improvement. It’s important that we keep our focus on action, and don’t fall into the trap of analysis paralysis or sticking to a slow, quiet path without risk. Decisions should be thoughtful, but delivering fast results requires the fearless acceptance of occasionally making mistakes; our bias for action also allows us to course correct quickly. Try to get results as fast as possible, but without compromising our other values and ways of working When a decision is in place, we expect people to commit to executing it. Any past decisions and guidelines are open to questioning as long as you act in accordance with them until they are changed. This is a common principle . Every decision can be changed; our best decision was one that changed an earlier one . In a manager-report relationship, usually the report is the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI). The manager may disagree with the final decision, but they still commit to the decision of the DRI. In a group setting, participants may disagree with a proposal but not articulate their views for one reason or another. Sometimes, many or all individuals may disagree yet choose not to speak up , because no one believes they would get agreement from the group. As a result, everyone loses out on their feedback. Dissent is expression of that disagreement. However, it can be difficult and even socially expensive. Expression of feedback is a way for everyone to grow and learn, and is based on facts rather than opinions . Share your perspective, rather than agreeing simply to avoid conflict or to go along with everyone else. When you want to reopen the conversation on something, show that your argument is informed by previous conversations and assume the decision was made with the best intent . You have to achieve results on every decision while it stands, even when you are trying to have it changed. You should communicate with the DRI who can change the decision instead of someone who can’t. If there is a disagreement and you can’t move forward because of it, agree to escalate and escalate to one or both of your managers. Early escalation, delivered with context of the challenge, enables managers to function as an unblocker. Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate results when we do what we promised to each other, customers, users, and investors. At GitLab, efficiency means producing results without wasting materials, time, or energy. We optimize solutions globally for the broader GitLab community over one person or a small group. Focus on efficiency should be global in nature, not just local to a given function. Global efficiency could include efficiency with customers, candidates, and contributors as well. It is easy to prioritize consistency over efficiency because consistency is often more efficient initially and makes managing processes more efficient. We should slow down when optimizing for consistency. Taking a company-wide lens when evaluating changes will help ensure that new processes will improve efficiency for GitLab as a whole and be the best decision for the company as a whole. When we work internally with other team members, we leverage GitLab’s unique working practices and operating principles to achieve top efficiency. We do not expect people outside of GitLab to conform to GitLab’s ways of working, and we will make accommodations to work effectively with them. For example, we may collaborate heavily in-person and not default to async communications. Most companies regress to the mean and slow down over time. While some changes are required as a company grows and matures, not all change is inevitable or should be allowed to passively happen. As GitLab grows, we are conscious of how we operate and how it enables our ability to continue to operate with the agility of a startup . We try to limit ourselves to healthy constraints . We document everything: in the handbook, in meeting notes, in issues. We do that because “ the faintest pencil is better than the sharpest memory .” It is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain. Having something in version control also lets everyone contribute suggestions to improve it. Use the simplest and most boring solution for a problem, and remember that “boring” should not be conflated with “bad” or “technical debt.” The speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps. Don’t pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun; using established, popular tech will ensure a more stable and more familiar experience for you and other contributors. Make a conscious effort to recognize the constraints of others within the team. For example, sales is hard because you are dependent on another organization, and development is hard because you have to preserve the ability to quickly improve the product in the future. Team members should first search for their own answers and, if an answer is not readily found or the answer is not clear, ask in public as we all should have a low level of shame . Write down any new information discovered and pay it forward so that those coming after will have better efficiency built on top of practicing collaboration, inclusion, and documenting the results. Team members have more room to grow themselves when they are able to self-service and self-learn. Optimize solutions globally for the broader GitLab community. As an example, it may be best to discard a renewal process that requires thousands of customers to each spend two hours in favor of one that only takes sixty seconds, even when it may make a monthly report less efficient internally! In a decision, ask yourself “For whom does this need to be most efficient?” Quite often, the answer may be your users, contributors, customers, or team members that are dependent upon your decision. Consider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings and a permission process. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, and you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions. Every dollar we spend will have to be earned back. Be as frugal with company money as you are with your own. In saying this, we ask team members to weigh the cost of purchases against the value that they will bring to the company. Consider the degree to which a purchase increases your ability to better accomplish your work and achieve business results relative to cost. Lowering overhead reduces the cost to operate the business and lets us shift spend toward other priority areas. We have guidelines around this operating principle to help team members better understand our expensing process and expectations. Amazon states it best with: “Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.” Give short answers to verbal questions so the other party has the opportunity to ask more or move on. Keep one-to-many written communication short, as mentioned in this HBR study : “A majority say that what they read is frequently ineffective because it’s too long, poorly organized, unclear, filled with jargon, and imprecise.” We want each team member to be a manager of one who doesn’t need daily check-ins to achieve their goals. Team members are given the freedom to own projects and initiatives and are trusted to see them through to a successful end. When team members are managers of one they can have an increased work/life balance, because they are more empowered to make decisions around how they allocate their time throughout each day. When possible, we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that, instead of imposing rules and approval processes. You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit. Freedom and responsibility are more efficient than rigidly following a process, or creating interdependencies , because they enable faster decision velocity and higher rates of iteration . When team members have freedom and responsibility over rigidity, they have more room to help others. Not every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient; a mistake only affects one. Once you have accepted the mistake, learn from it. When team members are free to accept mistakes, they can take more calculated risks. We value constant improvement by iterating quickly, month after month. If a task is not the smallest viable and valuable thing , cut the scope. Adoption of features, user requirements, and the competitive landscape change frequently and rapidly. The most successful companies adapt their roadmap and their organization quickly to keep pace. One of the things that makes this challenging is the impact on our team. People may need to change teams, subject matter, or even who manages them. This can rightly feel disruptive. If we coach ourselves to embrace the positive aspects of change, such as increased opportunity and new things to learn, we can move faster as a company and increase our odds of success. It is important to hold management accountable for being deliberate . Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate efficiency when we work on the right things, not doing more than needed, and not duplicating work. Diversity, inclusion and belonging are fundamental to the success of GitLab. We aim to make a significant impact in our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We are designing a multidimensional approach to ensure that GitLab is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. We actively chose to build a culture that is inclusive and supports all team members equally in the process of achieving their professional goals. We work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in our community and company. Take initiative to operate asynchronously whenever possible. This shows care and consideration for those who may not be in the same time zone, are traveling outside of their usual time zone, or are structuring their day around pressing commitments at home or in their community. This is demonstrated by communicating recordings of meetings , using GitLab Issues and Merge Requests rather than texts, calls, or Slack messages, and being sensitive to local holidays and vacation statuses. Encourage others to default to documentation rather than pressuring others to be online outside of their working hours. Part of embracing diversity is a willingness to embrace often uncomfortable conversations and situations. This concept is also at the core of inclusion and helping to eliminate the problems that are faced by certain GitLab team members who may not be in the majority. We believe that being willing to embrace discomfort is the path forward to a safe, balanced and inclusive work place for all. Challenge yourself, challenge your own pre-set notions and ideas about different cultures or things you don’t understand. When we are willing to embrace being uncomfortable, we can focus on actually fixing the issues at hand rather than simply “appearing to care”. Microaggressions are much more than merely rude or insensitive comments. They can wear people down by slowly chipping away their sense of belonging/safety/inclusion over time. What is a microaggression? “The everyday slights, indignities, put downs and insults that people of color, women, LGBT populations or those who are marginalized experiences in their day-to-day interactions with people.” - Derald W. Sue At GitLab we believe that everyone is entitled to a safe working space where they can express who they are and participate in conversations without worry of being spoken to in a harmful way, given that we want to encourage everyone to be mindful of what is a microaggression and be mindful of their potential impact. We believe that team members seeking feedback from a diverse group of team members, inside and outside of their group or function, leads to better decisions and a greater sense of team member belonging. For more guidance on how we define Diversity, please refer to GitLab’s definition of Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging . Feedback from a more heterogenous group often leads to better business outcomes as we incorporate diverse perspectives and uncover unconscious bias. An example of this operating principle in action showcases the value of actively seeking diverse perspectives. The term “Brag Document” was used to describe when individuals documented their accomplishments. Documenting accomplishments is critical to team member development. However, team members had the psychological safety to raise the question of whether or not the title of the document made some feel uncomfortable. In an effort to seek a diverse perspective , a survey was conducted in one of the Team Member and Advocacy Resource Group (TMRG) channels. The poll results showed that 100% of those polled preferred a different title and the title was changed. One of the unique elements to an all-remote culture is the ability to visit a person’s home while collaborating. If the tenor of the meeting allows, feel welcome to invite your family members or pets to drop by and greet your colleagues. Be mindful of language and use of profanity to encourage a family-friendly environment. Caregiving, outreach programs, and community service do not conveniently wait for regular business hours to conclude. If there’s a cause or community effort taking place, feel welcome to work with your manager and shift your working hours to be available during a period where you’ll have the greatest impact for good. For colleagues supporting others during these causes, document everything and strive to post recordings so it’s easy for them to catch up. People feel more included when they’re supported. To encourage this, and to support diversified learning across departments, consider GitLab’s Internship for Learning program. We don’t hire based on culture or select candidates because we’d like to have a drink with them. We hire and reward team members based on our shared values as detailed on this page. We want a values fit , not a culture fit. We want cultural diversity instead of cultural conformity. Said differently: “culture add” > “culture fit” or “hire for culture contribution” since our mission is that everyone can contribute . We generally avoid discussing politics or religion in public forums because it is easy to alienate people that have a minority opinion. This doesn’t mean we never discuss these topics. Because we value diversity, inclusion and belonging, and want all team members to feel welcome and contribute equally, we encourage free discussion of operational decisions that can move us toward being a more inclusive company. There is sometimes a grey area where advocating for diversity and political activities may intersect. Team members should use discretion in grey area communications, because a culture of belonging requires us to be respectful of the broad spectrum of views within our work environment. What does this mean in practice? Please feel empowered to share information that highlights diversity, inclusion and belonging issues and how GitLab and GitLab team members can get involved. In line with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics , avoid posting articles that reference specific political figures or parties. While it is acceptable for individuals to bring up politics and religion in social contexts such as coffee chats and real-life meetups with other coworkers (with the goal to understand and not judge), always be aware of potential sensitivities, exercise your best judgment, and make sure you stay within the boundaries of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics . We’re a global company where perspectives and local norms may differ from culture to culture. Diversity, inclusion and belonging is about broad inclusion at a worldwide level. If there is a question or concern, please reach out to diversityinclusion@gitlab.com or #diversity_inclusion_and_belonging . Unexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting. Celebrate and encourage quirky gifts, habits, behavior, and points of view. Open source is a great way to interact with interesting people. We try to hire people who think work is a great way to express themselves. Do not make jokes or unfriendly remarks about characteristics of the people who make up GitLab and how they identify . Everyone has the right to feel safe when working for GitLab and/or as a part of the GitLab community. We do not tolerate abuse, harassment , exclusion, discrimination, or retaliation by/of any community members, including our team members. You can always refuse to deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable. We recognize that unconscious bias is something that affects everyone and that the effect it has on us as humans and our company is large. We are responsible for understanding our own implicit biases and helping others understand theirs. We are continuously working on getting better at this topic . We list our Parental Leave publicly so people don’t have to ask during interviews. Use inclusive language. For example, prefer “Hi everybody” or “Hi people” to “Hi guys”, and “they” instead of “he/she”. While there are several good guides from folks like Buffer , APA and The Northern Ireland Civil Services on using inclusive language, we don’t keep an exhaustive list. When new possibly non-inclusive words arise, we prefer to be proactive and look for an alternative. If your goal is to be inclusive, it is more effective to make a small adjustment in the vocabulary when some people have a problem with it, rather than making a decision to not change it because some people don’t think it is a problem. And if you make a mistake (e.g. accidentally using the wrong pronoun or an outdated phrase), acknowledge it, apologize gracefully and move on ; there is no need to dwell on it, and you can work to avoid making that mistake in the future. Please also visit our Gender and Sexual-orientation Identity Definitions and FAQ page if you have questions around pronouns and other topics related to gender / sexual orientation. We attach part of our identity to our names, and if it is mispronounced it can feel less inclusive. If it happens repeatedly, you may be unintentionally sending a message to that person that you are not interested in learning how to pronounce their name correctly. This applies to everyone you are in contact with: team members, customers, candidates for jobs, and anyone else. People whose name is repeatedly mispronounced might feel unimportant or self-conscious, and might not speak up about it. Other negative behaviors include giving a person a nickname without their permission, or actively avoiding using their name in sync calls. It might be challenging to pronounce names from a different language or culture than your own, but with some effort, name pronunciation can be learned by anyone. Some ways to achieve this are: Some people might choose to use a nickname, for example: “Bob” instead of “Robert”. As long as this is their choice this is perfectly acceptable. We should avoid assigning a nickname to a person without their permission. Slack has two features to help with this issue: the phonetic name pronunciation field and the ability to record your own name pronunciation audio clip. We encourage all team members to complete both of these. Update them by editing your profile . This is documented on our page about interviewing . Be consciously inclusive in meetings by giving everyone present an opportunity to talk and present their points of view. This can be especially important in a remote setting. With internal meetings, consider using an agenda document for questions. For example, with GitLab AMAs , every meeting has a numbered list that GitLab team members can add questions to. During the meeting, questions are answered in turn and discussions noted in the same document. Sometimes, these documents can have so much traffic (during the meeting) such that only a limited number of people can edit the document. In these situations, those who have questions should post on zoom chat and those who can edit the document should help copy the question over to the document. In addition, those who can edit the document should also post in zoom chat to see if anyone has any questions that they could help add to the document so that meeting attendees are more empowered to contribute to the conversation. Customers are not used to working in this way. To promote inclusion with customers: ask participants for their goals; make sure during demos that you pause for question; leave time for discussion. Being globally distributed has the benefit that someone can cover for you when you are off work. However, population density is not balanced across timezones. Policies should remain fair to those in less dense regions. For example, the Asia Pacific region covers more timezones but has fewer team members. If we use an algorithm to assign tasks to those in later timezones, all American tasks would fall on the fewer Asia Pacific employees. This can damage belonging and inclusivity and should be avoided. When planning an event, the organizer should cater for location density differences to maximize participation in all regions. As a globally-dispersed company, we have team members from many different backgrounds and cultures. That means it is important for each of us to use great judgment in being respectful and inclusive of our teammates. At the same time, we may sometimes not fully realize we have said or done something to offend someone. It is important that our teammates hold each other accountable and let them know if they have unintentionally or intentionally done something so they can learn and gain additional understanding of perspectives different from our own. It is also important that our teammates don’t feel excluded or minimized by the words we use or the things we do. Thus, we all need to speak up when we see something that isn’t respectful or inclusive. Neurodiversity refers to variations in the human brain regarding learning, attention, sociability, mood, and other mental functions. There are various neurodevelopmental conditions, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, bipolarity, and other styles of neurodivergent functioning. While neurodivergent individuals often bring unique skills and abilities which can be harnessed for a competitive advantage in many fields (for example, cybersecurity ), neurodivergent individuals are often discriminated against. Due to non-inclusive hiring practices, they sometimes have trouble making it through traditional hiring processes. Neurodiversity inclusion best practices benefit everyone, and at GitLab, everyone can contribute. The handbook, values, strategy, and interviewing processes must support the ability for everyone to thrive. At GitLab we embrace Neurodiversity through adopting a variety of different work styles and communication styles, and we lean into transparency , asynchronous as a default working style, and pre-filled meeting agendas. These best practices become even more important when embracing neurodiversity. Providing multiple ways to consume information (written / video / audio) allows everyone to contribute independent of their preferred comprehension style. It is important to ask team members specifically what their preferred communication method is in order to provide them information in a format that is easily consumable for them. Remember, brains work differently and always assume positive intent , even if someone behaves in an unexpected way. While it may be an unexpected behavior to you, it may not be unexpected to the individual exhibiting the behavior. That is the beauty and value of diversity, embracing differences and becoming stronger and better as a result. We also recommend that all team members review the Reasonable Accommodation process. A Reasonable Accommodation for a team member could include noise-cancelling headphones, scheduling smaller group session zoom calls, providing very explicit and precise instructions and due-dates when given tasks, or providing a variety of supportive software tools. The most important thing that managers can do is facilitate an environment in which all team members feel psychologically safe enough to make requests for what they need in order to do their job. Long-lasting relationships are the rocks of life , and come before work. As someone said in our #thanks channel after helping a family member for five days after a hurricane: “THANK YOU to GitLab for providing a culture where “family first” is truly meant”. Use the hashtag: #FamilyAndFriends1st Equity vs. Equality: What’s the Difference? While the terms equity and equality may sound similar, the implementation of one versus the other can lead to dramatically different outcomes for marginalized people. Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome. Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate diversity, inclusion and belongings when we foster an environment where everyone can thrive and ensuring that GitLab is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. If you would like to improve your skills or expand your knowledge on topics relating to Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging at GitLab, check out our resources: Merriam-Webster defines iteration as the “the action or a process of iterating or repeating: such as a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result.” At GitLab, we iterate to do the smallest valuable thing to get fast feedback and efficiently reach a desired end goal . Feedback can be from internal users (dogfooding), a limited number of external users (through our early access program ), or through feedback from our broader user community. We validate each iteration and adjust, but not at the expense of the user experience that we deliver to our customers. When we iterate at GitLab, we break up the work that we know we need to do into smaller chunks to iterate toward a targeted end state: Iteration does not require us to ship features that are open to all users from day one. Feedback can come from internal users or a limited number of external users (early access program). Moving through the release process is not iteration though. Iteration is also not a replacement for having a plan . We expect you to know where you are going, but you can iterate to get there. An iteration might be additive (adding something) or subtractive (removing something). If you make suggestions that can be excluded from the first iteration, turn them into a separate issue that you link. While you should have a clear vision of the desired outcome and how it addresses a customer pain point or improves the user experience, be efficient in your planning. Unless you identify important cross-functional interdependencies, focus detailed planning on the first step. It might feel you are moving too slowly; however, planning is critical in order to ensure you can move fast when implementing. You’re doing it right if you feel that you have shipped the minimal feature set in the first iteration. This value is the one people most underestimate when they join GitLab. The impact, both on your work process and on how much you achieve, is greater than anticipated. Frequently, the simplest version that provides value turns out to be the best one. Many people who join GitLab say they already practice iteration. But this is the value that is the hardest to understand and adopt. People are trained that if you don’t deliver a perfect or polished thing, there will be a problem. If you do just one piece of something, you have to come back to it. Doing the whole thing seems more efficient, even though it isn’t. If the complete picture is not clear, your work might not be perceived as you want it to be perceived. It seems better to make a comprehensive product. They see other GitLab team members being really effective with iteration but don’t know how to make the transition, and it’s hard to shake the fear that constant iteration can lead to shipping lower-quality work or a worse product. In reality, it is possible to ship a minimally valuable product while continuing to adhere to the documented quality standards. The way to resolve this is to write down only what value you can add with the time you have for this project right now. That might be 5 minutes or 2 hours. Think of what you can complete in that time that would improve the current situation. Iteration can be uncomfortable, even painful. If you’re doing iteration correctly, it should be. Reverting work back to a previous state is positive, not negative. We’re quickly getting feedback and learning from it. Making a small change prevented a bigger revert and made it easier to revert. However, if we take smaller steps and ship smaller, simpler features, we get feedback sooner. Instead of spending time working on the wrong feature or going in the wrong direction, we can ship the smallest product, receive fast feedback, and course correct. People might ask why something was not perfect. In that case, mention that it was an iteration, you spent only “x” amount of time on it, and that the next iteration will contain “y” and be ready on “z”. Iteration enables results and efficiency . In the GitLab Unfiltered video embedded above, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij shares key operating principles to reinforce iteration in an organization. Iteration involves driving results in pursuit of a long-term vision. While the intermediate goals may change as we iterate, we are unlikely to be successful if we don’t start with a vision of what we are working toward. Shipping that vision in iterations allows us to learn from customers using it and adjust the vision if needed. Iteration for the sake of iteration can lead to inefficiencies and not deliver desired results. Iteration without a plan can lead to inefficiencies and a subpar customer experience. Before iterating we need to plan. A plan should include: Moving through the release process is not iteration. The release process can include: While development stages can be used to indicate release progress, is not itself iteration. If we are not aware of interdependencies beyond our team, and we are not collaborating with others across the organization, we risk deliverables that settle into a “local maximum” of quality, richness, and efficiency. This localization is largely defined by team structure and organizational boundaries. While an iteration can take place within a single team, that team is responsible for identifying inter-dependencies and proactively communicating and aligning with other teams working on related projects. This helps ensure that iterations are not “half-baked” and align with work being done across the entire organization. Don’t wait on the small things. When you have something of value like a potential blog post or a small fix, implement it straight away. Right now, everything is fresh in your head and you have the motivation. Inspiration is perishable. Don’t wait until you have a better version. Don’t wait until you record a better video. Don’t wait for an event (like GitLab Summit ). Inventory that isn’t released is a liability since it has to be managed, becomes outdated, and you miss out on the feedback you would have received had you implemented it straight away. When we don’t wait we signal intent to others that we have a purpose to resolve something. Note : “Don’t wait” should not be used as a justification for not iterating toward the global maximum or at expense of the plan. If there are interdependencies to be considered or the iteration is customer facing, slow down and ensure that we are considering what is best for GitLab and our customers. We always try to set a due date. If needed, we cut scope. If we have something planned for a specific date, we make that date. For example we shipped over 133 monthly releases . But every one of them doesn’t contain all the features we planned. If we planned an announcement for a certain date, we might announce less or indicate what is still uncertain. But we set a due date because having something out there builds trust and gives us better feedback. As discussed in Sid’s interview on iteration , waiting for approval can slow things down. We can prevent this with automation (such as tests of database migration performance) or clean-up after the fact (refactor a Pajamas if something was added that isn’t coherent), but we try to ensure that people don’t need to wait for sign-off. As iteration does not require us to ship to all users on day one, we can clean up after an internal or beta release to mitigate the negative impact to all customers. Iteration does not mean being open to all users from day one. If you do a gradual rollout of your change, prefer: Short iterations reduce our cycle time . Merging frequently also prevents merge conflicts. Small iterations make it easier to work with the wider community. Their work looks more like our work, and our work is also quicker to receive feedback. We encourage MVCs to be as small as possible. Always look to make the quickest change possible to improve the user’s outcome. If you validate that the change adds more value than what is there now, then do it. This may be additive (adding something) or subtractive (removing something). No need to wait for something more robust. More information is in the product handbook , but this applies to everything we do in all functions. Specifically for product MVCs, there is additional responsibility to validate with customers that we’re adding useful functionality without obvious bugs or usability issues. If you need to decide something as a team, make a concrete proposal instead of calling a meeting to get everyone’s input. Having a proposal will be a much more effective use of everyone’s time. Every meeting should be a review of a proposal. We should be brainwriting on our own instead of brainstorming out loud . State the underlying problem so that people have enough context to propose reasonable alternatives. The people that receive the proposal should not feel left out and the person making it should not feel bad if a completely different proposal is implemented. Don’t let your desire to be involved early or to see your solution implemented stand in the way of getting to the best outcome. If you don’t have a proposal, don’t let that stop you from highlighting a problem, but please state that you couldn’t think of a good solution and list any solutions you considered. By making a proposal you also provide better visibility into the work and the context surrounding it. In this GitLab Unfiltered video , GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij converses about iteration in engineering, leveraging proposals to break work into smaller components. At GitLab, we rarely mark any content or proposals as drafts. Everything is always in draft and subject to change. When everything is in draft, contributions from team members as well as the wider community are welcomed. By having everything in draft and assuming others have low context , confusion can be reduced as people have shared access to information. As we continue to expand the number of users we have, they will continue to expect stability and reliability. We must optimize for the long term without sacrificing stability along the way. This means that users may be inconvenienced in the short term, but current and future users will enjoy a better product in the end. Educating users on the longer-term plan helps create a shared understanding of how a small change will incrementally grow into something more. For example, we could share how a dropdown will evolve into a much more nuanced solution in the future. We can take the following steps to articulate our plan: In many organizations, you take a risk when you put forth any work that’s not perfect, work where you haven’t spent endless cycles planning for contingencies or counterpoints. Because of this, you’re incentivized to invest a lot of time and effort into preparing for ‘What if?’ scenarios before any work is presented, even if the release is not customer facing and there is a low level of risk in imperfection. The downside to that is clear when we are dogfooding: If you do eventually put forth the work, but it needed to be course-corrected a long time ago, you’ve squandered time that you could have spent improving it through iteration. Having a low level of shame when dogfooding or working internally requires you to combat a natural inclination to conceal work until it’s perfect, and instead celebrate the small changes. Cultural differences can bring unique challenges and expectations to iteration. For some, expressions like “it doesn’t have to be perfect...” can challenge cultural norms. We encourage you to bring your authentic self and seek shared understanding when iterating. Giving feedback and ensuring psychological safety are necessary for every iterative attempt. We believe great companies sound negative because they focus on what they can improve, not only on what is working well. In every conversation, inside and outside the company, we should ask a question: What do you think we can improve? This doesn’t mean we don’t recognize our successes; for example, see our Say Thanks value. We are positive about the future of the company. We are S hort Te rm C ritical A nd L ong T erm O ptimistic ( STeCALTO , for short). First, optimize for speed and results (and be deliberate about how your change affects other processes/functionality); when it is a success, figure out how to scale it. Great examples are in this article by Paul Graham . Resist the urge to bundle a series of smaller iterations so team members don’t see a project as their last (or best) opportunity to contribute. It’s tempting to create encompassing projects or initiatives that roll many smaller projects up. This incarnation of scope creep drives up cost, encourages fewer risks, and incentivizes perfection (via longer cycle times) over progress. When we resist bundling, we reduce the risk that work will be canceled due to scale or scope. By resisting bundling we also reduce the coordination needed because fewer people or teams may be involved. Most decisions are easy to reverse. In these cases, the Directly Responsible Individual should go ahead and make them without approval. Only when you can’t reverse them should there be a more thorough discussion. By embracing iteration and making two-way door decisions, we are more efficient and achieve more results. Changing something without shipping it is a revision, not iteration. Only when the change is rolled out to users, whether internal users or a limited customer group , can you learn from feedback. When you’re changing a proposal based on different opinions, you’re frequently wasting time; it would be better to roll out a small change quickly and get real world feedback. Never call a revision an iteration because it is almost the opposite. In order to embrace iteration, we should have the attitude that we are trying to achieve as much as possible in a small amount of time; it’s where we land at the end state of an iteration that counts. The benefit of iteration is to get fast feedback from users. Focus on sharing context at the end of the first iteration rather than a hypothetical future state that requires multiple iterations. By embracing iteration we can increase creativity in incremental components. When you are submitting a merge request for a code change, or a process change in the handbook, keep it as small as possible. If you are adding a new page to the handbook, create the new page with a small amount of initial content, get it merged quickly via Handbook Usage guidelines , and then add additional sections iteratively with subsequent merge requests. Similarly, when adding features to GitLab, consider ways to reduce the scope of the feature before creating the merge request to ensure your merge request is as small as possible. Rapid iteration can get in the way of results if it’s not thought out; for example, when adjusting our marketing messaging (where consistency is key), product categories (where we’ve set development plans), organizational structure or product scope alignment (where real human stresses and team stability are involved), sales methodologies (where we’ve trained our teams) and this values page (where we use the values to guide all GitLab team members). In those instances, we add additional review to the approval process; not to prohibit, but to be more deliberate in our iteration. The change process is documented in the GitLab Handbook Usage page and takes place via merge request approvals. Iteration is often counterintuitive and difficult to do. To clarify what an iteration is, it helps to see examples of what is not an iteration. Below are 12 examples of things we’ve seen mistaken as iteration, but don’t meet our definition of iteration. In this GitLab Unfiltered video , GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij elaborates on each of these 12 things that are not iteration. Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate iteration when we do the smallest viable and valuable thing, get it out quickly for feedback, and make changes based that feedback. Be open about as many things as possible. By making information public, we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. Use public issue trackers, projects, and repositories when possible. Transparency is not communication. Just because something exists in the handbook or elsewhere doesn’t mean it can’t be communicated again or in a more robust fashion to the people who need to understand or acknowledge it. On a personal level, be direct when sharing information, and admit when you’ve made a mistake or were wrong. When something goes wrong, it is a great opportunity to say “What’s the kaizen moment here?” and find a better way without hurt feelings. Even as a public company , we know that our value of transparency will be key to our success. This value can be hard to follow at times. You might ask yourself: what should be shared, how much to share, whether or not to speak up but definitely take the time to always opt for maximum transparency by adhering to the operating principles below. Often, company values get diluted as they grow, most likely because they do not write anything down. But we will make sure our values scale with the company. As a public company , we declare everyone in the company as an insider, which allows us to remain transparent internally about our numbers, etc. Everything else that can be transparent will continue to be so. When there are exceptions, material that is not public by default is documented . Everything at GitLab is public by default. The public process does two things: allows others to benefit from the conversation and acts as a filter. Since there is only a limited amount of time, we prioritize conversations that a wider audience can benefit from. One example of transparency at GitLab is the public repository of this website that also contains this company handbook . Others include the GitLab CE and GitLab EE issue trackers, as well as marketing and infrastructure . Transparency creates awareness for GitLab, allows us to recruit people that care about our values, gets us more and faster feedback from people outside the company, and makes it easier to collaborate with them. It is also about sharing great software, documentation, examples, lessons, and processes with the whole community and the world in the spirit of open source, which we believe creates more value than it captures. In line with our value of transparency and being public by default, all GitLab team member profiles should be public. Public profiles also enable broader collaboration and efficiencies between teams. To do so, please make sure that the checkbox under the Private profile option is unchecked in your profile settings . If you do not feel comfortable with your full name or location on your profile, please change it to what feels appropriate to you as these are displayed even on private profiles. Because we are public by default and have the SAFE framework we don’t need to make cases for why things should be transparent. If something is unSAFE and needs to remain not public it can be. We make information public by default because transparency is one of our values . However it is most important to focus on results . Therefore, a category of information is public unless there is a reason for it not to be. If something is not public, there should be a reference in the handbook that states a confidential decision was taken with a link to our Not Public guidelines, unless GitLab Legal and Corporate Affairs believes it carries undue risk. We document what is not public by default on our communication page. If you believe something shouldn’t be public that currently is (or vice versa), then make a merge request to the relevant page(s) suggesting the change so that you can collaborate with others and discuss with the DRI . When content contains information which is not public it is recommended to remove the specific sections which are not public, put them on their own page in the internal handbook, and then link out to that with a “not public/internal only” note. Always share publicly what we can. When information is not public, it may also be treated as limited access, only shared with certain GitLab roles, teams, or team members due to privacy considerations, contractual obligation, or other reasons that the author or DRI can specify. Certain kinds of information default to limited access, including details about team members or customers who did not give permission to share the information. Most companies become non-transparent over time because they don’t accept any mistakes. Instead, we should always err on the side of transparency when there is a choice to be made between caution or inaction, and transparency. If we make a mistake, we now know what the limits of transparency are for the company and we should document this . The only exception to this rule would be in the case when there are legal concerns. Because some information is not public the public information can be lacking some context. We should be cognizant of that. Being direct is about being transparent with each other. We try to channel our inner Ben Horowitz by being both straightforward and kind . Feedback is always about your work and not your person. That doesn’t mean it will be easy to give or receive it. If you state one thing, and then change course and support a different direction, point, or outcome, articulate this. It is OK to have your position changed by new data. Articulating that an earlier stance is not your current stance provides clarity to others and encourages data-driven decision making. Be transparent to the right people (up) at the right time (when still actionable). If you make a mistake, don’t worry; correct it and proactively let the affected party, your team, and the CEO know what happened, how you corrected it, and how—if needed—you changed the process to prevent future mistakes. We practice transparency even when hiding the facts would be easier. For example, many companies do not give you the real reason why they declined your application because it increases the chance of legal action. We want to only reject people for the right reasons and we want to give them the opportunity to grow by getting this feedback. Therefore, we’ll accept the increased risk of holding ourselves to a high standard of making decisions and do the right thing by telling them what we thought. Other examples are being transparent about security incidents and participating in and contributing to Live Broadcasts. Transparency has costs (distraction, mis-interpretation, etc.) but also great benefits (productivity, hiring, retention, brand awareness, etc). We should carefully weigh the tradeoff between costs and benefits, to prevent a knee-jerk reaction to reduce transparency when it has costs. By having most company communications and work artifacts be public to the Internet, we have one single source of truth for all GitLab team members, users, customers, and other community members. We don’t need separate artifacts with different permissions for different people. Our transparency value means more than just making information accessible to all. In order to improve performance it’s important that we not only ensure information is accessible, but also ensure it flows to the correct places and is findable by those who need it. Focusing on information flow will ensure you, for example, utilize multi-modal communication , or that you keep your stakeholders informed of changes by posting links to MRs in Slack. Transparent changes have the reasons for the change laid out clearly along with the change itself. This leads to fewer questions later on because people already have some understanding. A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of questioning, which is less efficient. This also helps with institutional memory: a year from now when you want to know why a decision was made, or not, the issue or MR that has the decision also shares why the decision was made. This is related to Chesterton’s fence - it’s much easier to suggest removing or changing something if you know why it exists in the first place. If you use generalized terms such as “industry standard” or “best practices,” be sure to give context, as without context they can be seen as potentially vague or opaque. Similarly, merely stating a single value isn’t a great explanation for why we are making a particular decision. Many things could be considered “iteration” or “efficiency” that don’t match our definition of those values. Try to link to an operating principle of the value or provide more context, instead of just saying a single value’s name. Saying why and not just what enables discussion around topics that may impact more than one value; for instance, when weighing the efficiency of boring solutions with the focus on customer results . When decisions align with all of our values, they are easy to discuss and decide. When there are multiple values involved, using our values hierarchy and directly discussing the tradeoffs is easier with more context. Articulating why also helps people understand how something changed when you articulate that you changed your mind . Saying why does not mean justifying a decision against all other suggestions. The DRI is responsible for their decision. The DRI is not responsible for convincing other people, but they should be able to articulate their reasoning for the change. When a GitLab Team Member comes across an ask or material (MR, handbook, etc.) that does not provide a “why” with sufficient context, the Team Member is responsible for getting the why and, if needed, working with the DRI to ensure that it is adequately documented and communicated to give context to other team members. In the absence of a why, team members may speculate the why. This is something that can lead to disruption and inefficiency. Enable everybody involved to come to the same conclusion as you. This not only involves reasoning , but also providing, for example: raw data and not just plots; scripts to automate tasks and not just the work they have done; and documenting steps while analyzing a problem. Do your best to make the line of thinking transparent to others, even if they may disagree . Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate transparency when we are open with as many things as possible reducing the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. Our values provide guidelines on how to behave and are written to be actionable. They help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from GitLab team members. They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values provide a framework for distributed decision making, detailed in GitLab’s TeamOps management philosophy. They allow individuals to determine what to do without asking their manager and they allow teams to make consistent decisions. When teams across the organization reference the same values in their decision making, there is consistency in how decisions are made. This ensures that our culture remains driven by our values. Lastly, values create a conscious culture that is designed to help you prosper and experience exceptional personal growth through work. Our values also help us to prevent the five dysfunctions : Some dysfunctions are not addressed directly by our values; for example, trust is not one of our values. Similar to happiness, trust is something that is an outcome, not something you can strive for directly. We hope that the way we work and our values will instill trust, instead of mandating it from people; trust is earned, not given. Operating principles are behaviors that empower GitLab team members to definitively live out a given value. They clarify what a given core value means and looks like at GitLab . Understanding this distinction is critical to thriving at GitLab, particularly for newer team members who may be familiar with a prior organization’s interpretation of iteration or collaboration (as examples). Values are not just things we do, but things that actively drive good behavior. When we remove them it doesn’t mean we stopped believing in it, just that it wasn’t actively helping to drive behavior. If we don’t prune our operating principles, then we will be like every other company: things that make sense but are not leading to a better culture. Most companies have a list of values. In companies without strong values, folks often use generalizations when they refer to values. For example, “not a value add” or “scored well on values during our interview.” In companies with strong values, folks name the specific, relevant value as it applies to a given topic or situation. Values are only powerful when they are individually understood and applied by team members. For certain business decisions or projects (such as compensation and end-point management ), GitLab team members may have a lot of opinions and interest, and they want to provide their feedback and comments. On the other hand, it might be challenging for the project DRI to digest and respond to all these inputs. What should you do in this scenario? Everyone can contribute at GitLab. We encourage team members to share feedback and leave comments on issues. Leaving feedback and comments shows that team members care about a topic and about GitLab as a company. These perspectives may also uncover potential risks and problems in the project. There shouldn’t be a “Don’t they have their job to do?” type of response. Furthermore, we shouldn’t judge team members who are perceived as being the “squeaky wheel.” At GitLab, we measure impact, not activity . As long as a team member is producing required results, they are empowered to decide how to spend their time. On the other hand, as GitLab grows in size, we need to make decisions and the decisions may not be agreed to by everyone. If a decision or project is sensitive or controversial, and receives large amounts of feedback, it can be challenging for the project DRI to handle. In these cases, it’s best to have time-boxed feedback built into timelines. In a hypothetical example where a DRI needs to decide between red and gold potatoes for a stew, they would create an issue with the following sentiment: We’re deciding between red potatoes and gold potatoes to go into the stew. We have to decide by Tuesday 2020-07-14 so that we can get our order to the grocery store on Wednesday 2020-07-15. We’ll be collecting input and feedback until that point. Jane is the DRI and will make the decision on 2020-07-14 with all the information we have at that point. Here is the framework we’re using for the decision: Once the decision is made, it will be what is going into the stew. This method has shown itself to be effective at soliciting productive feedback that doesn’t derail a timeline while ensuring team members feel heard. Companies are encouraged to copy and implement GitLab’s values. They are Creative Commons and can be copied verbatim. We make our values public for many reasons . There is great power and efficiency in teams who share company values. Concealing values until after someone is hired into an organization is not a wise strategy. Not everyone will see our values and feel aligned with them, and that’s OK. By making values public, it shows respect for the time of job seekers who conduct due diligence on prospective employers. When people who are aligned with GitLab’s values apply for an open vacancy , this allows our hiring teams to more efficiently move candidates through the interview process . Companies may ask you to write a blank check. They’ll say, ‘Come join our organization, and when you’re here, you need to subscribe to our values, our way of working, and our strategy. It’s very essential, and it’s part of our identity!’ But these companies don’t give you the opportunity up front to evaluate it. It doesn’t make any sense to me. If it’s so important that people share your values, have them out there. Occasionally, values can contradict each other. It’s useful to keep in mind this hierarchy to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent with our core values. Think of the hierarchy as a weighting system. Values higher in the hierarchy do not automatically override values lower in the hierarchy. Here are some examples: It’s an attempt to relieve at least some of the tension. It’s not absolute. If you think of values as binary, that’s not going to work. There will always be interpretation, and there’s always magnitude to consider. We made a hierarchy so that it’s clear, in the end, the result matters most. For instance, we’re not going to be transparent for the sake of being transparent. We’re not radical in our transparency. We do it because we think it will lead to better outcomes. Those hierarchies are really important. They won’t preempt every debate, but it helps. Our values are updated frequently and as needed. Everyone is welcome to make a suggestion to improve them. To update: make a merge request and assign it to the CEO. If you’re a team member or in the core team please post a link to the MR in the #values Slack channel . If you’re not part of those groups, please send a direct X/Twitter message to @sytses . Whatever behavior you reward will become your values. We reinforce our values by: Criteria we use for promotions and communicate to the whole company on announcement. What we select for during hiring . What we emphasize during on-boarding . Criteria we use for our annual compensation review . What we refer to when making decisions . The example the E-group sets for the company since a fish rots from the head down . What we expect from all team members, as ambassadors for our values . Keeping them up to date with a stream of commits that add details . Behavior we give each other 360 feedback on. Criteria we use for discretionary bonuses . What we include in our offer letters Criteria we use to manage underperformance . What we do when we let people go . Giving value awards during GitLab Summit . Providing GitLab team members and qualified individuals transparency into all aspects of the company through the CEO Shadow Program to enable them to better engage and collaborate cross-functionally. Linking the takeaways of courses to our values, like we did for the Crucial Conversations training . The default settings of the software we use (for example: Speedy meetings , document sharing , agendas, etc.) Reinforcing our values with features in GitLab, for example the Iterations feature . Applying one of our values virtual backgrounds in video calls. Our GitLab Song Book , the song lyrics often mention GitLab values. Regularly conduct a values exercise at the e-group offsite . The most important moments to reinforce our values are decisions which affect individual team members most: hiring, promotions, and bonuses, which is why every promotion document at GitLab is shared with the entire company and uses the values as its core structure. In negative feedback, we should be specific about what the problem is. For example, saying someone is “ not living the values ” isn’t helpful. Your values are what you hire for, what you praise people for, and what you promote them for. By definition, what you do in those instances are your values. It’s not what you say they are. Values should be explicitly part of our hiring process, our job profiles, and our review process . When we give bonuses and promotions , they are always linked to values. That’s the crucial thing. If you reinforce them there, that’s the most powerful thing you can do. — Sid Sijbrandij, GitLab co-founder Value erosion can occur when indifference and apathy are tolerated. It can also occur when individuals justify undesired behaviors by interpreting values as “me values” rather than “company values.” For example, a team member may speak to the importance of personal efficiency in order to justify not collaborating professionally with peers. This is not what we expect from team members in terms of efficiency and collaboration. If you feel that values are not being lived out in a given scenario, speak up and ask for context in a respectful manner. Navigating value conflicts starts with assuming positive intent from other team members. Offer links to relevant values and/or operating principles when discussing the issue. If there is confusion or disagreement about the interpretation of a value, please surface the discussion in GitLab’s #values Slack channel (for GitLab team members) or @-mentioning @gitlab on X/Twitter (for those who do not work at GitLab). Almost every time we face a hard decision at GitLab, it’s because values are in conflict. It’s not binary logic. It requires conversation, and sometimes there is no obvious answer. We can only achieve resolution by respectfully talking with each other and trusting the DRI to make the ultimate decision. From our values we excluded some behaviors that are obvious; we call them our permission to play behavior: We don’t want people to play politics at GitLab. An example of politics is people discussing a proposal and being overly focused on whose proposal it is. This is a manifestation of the Belief Bias , where we judge an argument’s strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how strongly we support the conclusion. Proposals should be weighed on their merits and not on who proposed them. Another example is people being promoted based on others liking them or having a lot of alliances. We want people to be promoted based on their results. We value collaboration, but that’s different from being promoted just because people like you. Below are some attributes of political and non-political work environments. GitLab plans to maintain a non-political one. Values make and clarify choices. A well-chosen value has a defensible opposite. Apple, for example, values secrecy over transparency and product perfection over iteration. They are successful building around our counter values — although the result is a very different company. During every GitLab 101 session with new hires we discuss our values. We document the questions and answers to Frequently Asked Questions about the GitLab Culture . New team members should read GitLab’s guide to starting a new remote role , and reference interviews centered on values within the GitLab Unfiltered YouTube channel . Our mission is to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world . This mission guides our path, and we live our values along that path. We have a page which documents our Mitigating Concerns . Many of our values help to mitigate some of these concerns."

    "title": "GitLab Communication",
    "paragraph": "We’re an all-remote company that allows people to work from almost anywhere in the world . We hire great people regardless of where they live, but with GitLab team members across more than 60 countries , it’s important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently. To accomplish this, we use asynchronous communication as a starting point and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, merge requests , and Slack channels . We also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down. When we go back and forth three times, we jump on a synchronous video call . We communicate respectfully and professionally at all times. Embracing asynchronous communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and communiques are the norm. Learn more about mastering the use of the written word in an all-remote setting . If you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Merge Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format. If there is an issue to raise regarding someone’s communication or conduct, team members should follow the process for raising communication concerns by sharing their concern with their manager or, if preferred, email Team Member Relations ( teammemberrelations@gitlab.com ) directly. In an all-remote setting , where team members are empowered to live and work where they’re most fulfilled, mastering asynchronous workflows is vital to avoiding dysfunction and enjoying outsized efficiencies and lifestyle flexibility. Asynchronous communication is the art of communicating and moving projects forward without the need for additional stakeholders to be available at the same time your communique is sent. To learn more on when to use asynchronous and synchronous communication, examples of async workflows in practice at GitLab, core async behaviors, and to take an async knowledge assessment, visit GitLab’s guide to embracing asynchronous communication . When working on a problem or issue, communicate directly with the people you need support from rather than working through reporting lines. Direct communication with the people you need to collaborate with is more efficient than working through your manager, their manager, or another intermediary. Escalate to management if you are not getting the support you need. Remember that everyone is a manager of one and they might have to complete their own assignments and inform the reporting lines. (This guidance supplements and overlaps with GitLab’s SAFE Framework , the guidance on the use of the internal handbook , and the additional guidance on this page. We ask our team members to consider the factors below in their communication. ) As GitLab matures, we want to continue to foster discussion while evolving our communication guidelines so that topics that are potentially GitLab sensitive are discussed in appropriate forums. This is particularly relevant as team members heavily leverage async modes of communication including merge requests, issues and epics, and in Slack communication. Words have impact long after they are written, and even when you’re communicating internally, the manner in which you speak with one another should be viewed through an external lens. For additional information, please review our Guidelines for communicating effectively and responsibly through text . At GitLab, we are public by default , but some information is classified as internal or limited access. Please see the confidentiality levels handbook page for details on this. The above examples overlap with the GitLab’s SAFE Framework examples. We recommend you to further review that page for more information and context. We encourage communicating risks to GitLab, its team members, or customers in a synchronous 1:1 setting. The table below outlines an overview of different communication forums at GitLab, and the considerations team members should think through related to potentially GitLab Sensitive topics when determining which forum to leverage. When in doubt, you can reach out to your People Business Partner and/or your leadership team directly. Please see our Project names section . Internal communication is any work related communication at a company. Internal Communication includes team member conversations, wider team discussions, or internal announcements to the company or targeted outreach to select internal audiences. At GitLab, everyone can contribute to the effectiveness of Internal Communications to support aspects of GitLab culture, such as intentional transparency and engaging people in open dialogue. Since we believe that all team members must be Managers of One , most communication is handled by the relevant group, but we know that some communications are more sensitive and contentious than others. In those cases, the DRIs may want to engage the Internal Communications function . We want to avoid unstructured content which includes FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), especially for internal communication. FAQs tend to take on the voice and concerns of assumed personas. Instead of assuming questions, aim to articulate key facts as statements and use these to structure content under topical headers which aren’t questions. Structured content around GitLab, the product, should be in GitLab Docs and structured content around GitLab, the company, should be in the handbook; we should not use separate documents or locations to share this information. As an example, let’s say your FAQ would have a question like: Q: I’m not seeing widget X, what should I do? A: If you’re not seeing widget X, you can verify if it’s enabled or not by going to User Profile -> Settings and ensure the checkbox is enabled under Enable widget X You can enable widget X by going to User Profile -> Settings and ticking the checkbox next to Enable widget X then clicking on the Save button Content guidelines across the industry support avoiding FAQs: Employ multimodal communication to broadcast important decisions. To reach our distributed organization, announce important decisions in the company announcements Slack channel, email the appropriate team email lists, Slack the appropriate channels, and target 1:1s or other important meetings on the same day, with the same information. When doing this, create and link to a single source of truth : ideally the handbook , otherwise an epic, issue, or Google Doc. The email or Slack message should not be the source of truth. When referring to email that recipients should have received, reference the sender and subject of the email so it’s easy to find. For example, “You should have received an email from Jane Smith with the subject ‘Training Seminar Details’”. If something is behaving strangely on https://gitlab.com , it might be a bug. It could also mean that something was changed intentionally. Please search if the issue has already been reported . If it has not been reported, and you are sure it is a bug, please file an issue . If you are unsure whether the behavior you experience is a bug, you may ask in the Slack channel #is-this-known . If you know which stage of the DevOps lifecycle is affected, it is also okay to ask in #s_{stage}, for example #s_manage . When taking notes in an agenda, in the handbook, or in other documents, keep items numbered so we can refer to Item 3 or 4a. The number is not a signal of the importance or rank of the subject unless explicitly stated to be such. It is just for ease of reference. Linking should not be in one direction. We should go beyond deep-linking to create a richer web of links that can surface content and ensure people consider all pages when making updates. When linking one page to another, try to link back as well. Instead of only linking from Page A to Page B, both link Page A to Page B and link Page B back to Page A. For example, the Live Doc Meeting section of the All Remote Guide links to the Live Docs Meetings page . The Live Docs Meetings page links back to the Live Doc Meeting section of the All Remote Guide. In informal acknowledgement scenarios, such as on Slack or on issue comments, it is common practice to use the following: In order to effectively communicate an important change to hundreds of distributed employees, we occasionally use an ACK process. To prevent overuse, this should only be used by a member of the exec team. Anyone may ask an exec to sponsor one. As a guideline, we’d expect no more than one per quarter to be sent out. Too many ACKs lose power. As we continue to build on inclusion , recognition is a key and transformative tactic. Thanking team members provides an opportunity for them to be recognized for their contributions, influences engagement behavior, and acknowledges to team members their work is seen. By saying thanks, you are contributing to and supporting the value of DIB . Add Values emoji reactions to thank you messages in the #thanks slack channel or feel free to use them in GitLab.com, other slack channels and social media, when you see alignment to our values: GitLab’s values . As a second iteration, we have added these custom emoji to GitLab to enable tanuki values reactions in issues, epics, and MRs within the gitlab-com and gitlab-org groups. As a later iteration, we will begin tracking the number of emoji reactions for each value through the Reacji API and update this page with our findings! Indicate your availability by updating your own calendar using Google’s “out of office” feature and include the dates you plan to be away in your automated response. Note that this feature will automatically decline any meeting invitations during the time frame you select. Informal communication is made up of interactions between co-workers that are unofficial in nature and focus on building social relationships outside of the normal hierarchy of a typical business structure. In other words, it’s what happens when we get to know each other and talk about anything other than work. Informal communication is a vital part of GitLab culture , and we’ve listed 20+ ways to engage . If there is something that you want to discuss, but you do not feel that it is a reasonable option to discuss with either your manager or CEO, then you can reach out to any of the other C-level GitLab team members . When possible, it’s best practice to start a discussion with a Merge Request (MR) instead of an issue. An MR is associated with a specific change that is proposed and transparent for everyone to review and openly discuss. The nature of MRs facilitate discussions around a proposed solution to a problem that is actionable. An MR is actionable, while an issue will take longer to take action on. Some merge requests that involve a big decision or change tend to collect a large amount of feedback. As GitLab grows in size, it is unrealistic for a single person to respond to potentially hundreds of comments. To remain efficient in these MRs and to make it scalable, it is important for the DRI to receive a clear signal of input that is shared on the merge request. Some MRs may be marked as “Manager Mention MRs” by clearly designating them as such at the beginning of the MR description with the following code block: Additionally, add the ~\"Manager Mention MR\" label to the merge request. This will make future analytics on Manager Mention merge requests more easily identifiable. It also enables managers to subscribe to the label to be notified when an MR has elected the Manager Mention MR designation. We tried Manager Mention MR’s for the first time in a recent announcement (2021-03-03) but this did not work well and we are working on making it better. We’re starting with a more thoughtful and transparent process in our communications cadence and approach going forward, including all directs and people managers getting a few days’ notice before important company-wide changes are announced to all team members. This will allow all directs and people managers to feel more enabled and better understand the why behind big changes in order to scale communication to team members. For all managers: It is important to ground yourself in the contents of the changes before the announcement goes live to all team members. If a team member tags you in a Manager Mention MR, it is your role to respond candidly and thoughtfully to their question or comment. If the line of questioning in the Manager Mention MR gets out of your depth, ask the DRI to help answer. If a team member comments without a manager tagged, the comment will be closed with a link to this handbook section or closed without comment. In a situation where a team member leaves a wildly inappropriate comment in the Manager Mention MR, you should feel empowered to delete comment and talk to your team member 1:1. Consider subscribing to the label ~\"Manager Mention MR\" to be notified when MRs transition to this designation. For team members: Check if the MR you are about to comment on has the ~\"Manager Mention MR\" label. Check each time as the label may have been added since you last commented. When leaving a comment in a Manager Mention MR, frame the comment as a question or suggestion to your manager directly, and not anyone else, including the DRI. We do this to scale communication, as it is unsustainable for the DRI to answer every question. MRs should not start out as a Manager Mention MR as we prefer communication to be direct . They should only be designated as such after the number of comments on them grows to a level that is unsustainable for the DRI. An exception to this is compensation changes and other company-wide announcements that can be sensitive/contentious in nature since they have historically generated many comments. When an MR is changed to be Manager Mention , the person making this change should add a comment stating this so that everyone tracking the MR can be informed. Issues are valuable when there isn’t a specific code change that is being proposed, such as: When utilizing issues, it is still important to maintain focus by defining a single specific topic of discussion and the desired outcome that would result in the resolution of the issue. Issues should not be open-ended or go stale due to lack of resolution. For example, a team member may open an issue to track the progress of a blog post with associated to-do items that need to be completed by a certain date (e.g. first draft, peer review, publish). Once the specific items are completed, the issue can successfully be closed. Below are a few things to remember when creating issues: Pro Tip: When creating a Merge Request you can add closes: #[insert issue number here] and when the Merge Request is merged, the issue will automatically close. You can see an example of this here . Note: Automatic issue closing is person with disability on some projects. Our company-wide announcements channel is #company-fyi . It is an announcement only channel, meaning that communications need to be approved before they can be posted. To minimize noise, announcements made in #company-fyi should not be duplicated in #whats-happening-at-gitlab . Be mindful of the attention economy . In order to post or have a message posted in #company-fyi , please reach out to the internal communications team or your function’s executive who can approve the message and post it. Examples of what should not go in #company-fyi (as per new group guidelines): The above should all go in the new #whats-happening-at-GitLab channel (formerly the #company-announcement channel). Due to the volume of posts in the Slack channel, we recommend that you do not use #whats-happening-at-gitlab as a sole location for important announcements as information might get lost or muted. Examples of important items include but are not limited to: Meetings are incredibly expensive since they require synchronous time. The most common meeting problems can all be addressed by following the above guidelines around scheduling meetings. Some of the most common meetings problems are outlined below: If folks are involved in a meeting and have capacity to do so, they should take notes using GitLab’s Live Doc Meetings principles . This is important, because: It may look like a few people are already taking notes, do not see this as a deterrent for helping. Initial note takers may be first to show up and then see it as their responsibility to continue if no one else is stepping in. While meetings recordings are helpful, written notes are more efficient to read and offer greater opportunities for async engagement. Takes notes even when a meeting is being recorded. GitLab Executive Business Administrators sometimes support teams by taking notes. Since note taking takes time away from their other activities and can often be done by other folks, consider the following before engaging an EBA in a meeting solely for note taking purposes. Note taking helps us to work asynchronously. Team members can add thoughts to an agenda in advance of a meeting and understand what was discussed if they cannot attend. It also offers a record of discussion. Consider the following best practice when taking notes in meetings: If at the start of the meeting, it does not look like all team members will contribute to note-taking, identify a set of note-takers who will be responsible for this activity within the meeting Utilize Zoom’s AI Companion to create and/or share a meeting summary. Meeting Summary with Zoom AI Companion uses AI technology, which may include third-party models, and allows meeting hosts to initiate an AI-generated summary of their meeting. When the host enables this feature in a meeting, participants may automatically receive a summary after the meeting ends, if the host chose to share it with them. Note-taking can be a lot for a single person to stay on top of–especially when there is a fast moving conversation with many speakers. Team members should still feel empowered to contribute by helping with notes as needed, even if there is someone assigned. Ask others to scribe answers in real-time to allow the person who asked the question to focus on the answer. Touch up the answer when the conversation has moved on to something less relevant. It can be hard to keep up with the dialog and capture quality notes when there’s fast back and forth conversation. Lead by example and write when you’re not talking, expect others will write when you’re talking. Focus on noting speakers and their key points over capturing all words said. Extensive note-taking should not happen at the expense of correct note-taking. Write down your questions in the agenda before vocalizing. Always ask people to vocalize their questions to provide the most detailed context and for audio-only playbacks. Use discretion in taking notes if sensitive topics are being discussed. For example, do not takes notes on not-public information if the agenda may be available to an audience who should not be privy to this information. If someone requests folks to stop taking notes, stop for the duration of the discussion unless there is verbal confirmation that note-taking should resume. Ask for the confirmation before typing before you resume note-taking. At the end of the meeting, clearly capture key takeaways, next steps, and DRIs . If you have any questions about what may or may not be a sensitive topic, please refer to our SAFE Framework or reach out via the #safe Slack channel Presenting during meetings requires valuable synchronous time. Instead, recorded presentations make content accessible, prevent confusion, and increase participation for team members that prefer consuming content asynchronously . Remember it is not required to have a presentation or have a pre-recorded presentation. In the video below, GitLab co-founder, Sid Sijbrandij, explains why there are no presentations in most meetings. Pre-recorded presentations enable: There are times when presenting during a meeting is needed. This may occur when adding more context to a specific topic on slides. If this is the case, consider the following: Best Practices for Pre-Recorded Presentations While most meetings should not have presentations, there are a few exceptions. Specifically, we may use synchronous touch points in meetings with large numbers of folks. These tend to be meetings used for building team cohesion and alignment. For example, GitLab Assembly or the Functional Leaders Meeting . GitLab has the following meeting framework for determining which meetings should have presentations: Introductions can be helpful during some external meetings, such as executive sales calls. In those meetings, use these guidelines: If you’re scheduling a meeting across multiple regions, consider using the time ranges below to respect common working hours. The suggested times are organized by the regions that you’re trying to accommodate. Each suggested window is shown in the local time zone. For example, if your meeting includes team members in EMEA and AMER, you could consider scheduling from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM Pacific Time. Note: Time zone offsets change throughout the year due to Daylight Savings Time, Summer Time, and similar time changes, so these suggested times may be less convenient at different times of year. When scheduling meetings with two or more sessions (usually when trying ensure worldwide coverage for all team members), name them after the topic, appended with a session number based on the order they show up in the calendar. Team members will see the meeting invites in their email or calendar in relation to their local time zone and can decide for themselves which session to attend, based on their working hours. You are the manager of your attention, and you decide when you do or don’t pay attention in a meeting. You will always have more work than time in your life. If you get invited to a meeting you don’t think you should go to, you should decline the meeting. It is better to cancel than to show up and not pay attention. On the other hand, not every part of a meeting is relevant, but it can sometimes be helpful to have more people in a call. If you only have one discussion point, if possible, try to reorder the meeting agenda to have your point first and then drop from the call. If you get asked a question when you’re not paying attention, it is an okay use of time to repeat a question every now and then. If training is required for one’s role, team members should plan to give the training full attention–especially if engagement in discussions or breakout rooms is required. If training is ’nice to learn’ or ‘optional’ for team members, multi-tasking can be done at the team members discretion. We don’t use the first 15 minutes of a meeting to read the materials like they do at Amazon . You can use the start of a meeting to review the materials for the meeting if you need to, given you do not have to be paying attention, but that should not delay the start of the meeting for the people that already have questions based on the materials. Meetings start on time at GitLab. Do not use your camera to signal you’re not paying attention; cameras should always be on . There are too few hours in a week, so we expect each team member to manage their attention . If you’re hosting a meeting, don’t tell people to give you their attention or stop multi-tasking. Respect each team member’s agency over their time. Instead of demanding attention, earn participants’ attention by organizing and facilitating meetings so they are compelling to attendees. You should take pride in being the first person to add a question to a meeting agenda, however unlike the First post meme we do want the first post to be more than just “First!”. The meeting DRI will be happy to see there is a question ready before to kick off the meeting. The Meeting DRI should remember to thank the person for asking the first question. Never do a countdown or say something like. “I’ll give it x seconds”, people are very unlikely to ask a question if you do that. Either ask for a question, wait for a question, or end the call. In calls that have remote participants everyone should use their own equipment (camera, headset, screen). When multiple people share equipment the following problems arise for remote participants : The people sharing equipment also have problems because they don’t have their own equipment: The disadvantages for remote people are much greater than for the sharing people and hard to notice for the sharing people. The disadvantages cause previously remote participants to travel to the meeting to be in person for a better experience. The extra travel is inefficient since it is time consuming, expensive, bad for the environment, and unhealthy. Theoretically you can have multiple people in a room with their own equipment but in practice it is much better to be in separate rooms: Ask Me Anything meetings can be a useful opportunity for team members to meet a new leader, learn more about an existing team member, or gain clarity on a recent change. Fireside chats are informal conversations between a host and a guest. The guest is typically a new leader, board member, or guest speaker. They are a useful opportunity to learn specific information about these individuals and their professional careers and personal interests. Fireside chats allow the audience to learn more about the guests in a casual and approachable setting. Format: In advance of the call, the host will prepare questions and share them with the guest. During the call, the host will moderate the conversation with the guest, by verbalizing the prepared questions. There is specific amount of time reserved at the end of the agenda for questions from attendees. A Walk and Talk call is when team members step away from their computers and get outside for a meeting. The difference between a coffee chat and a Walk and Talk call is that a Walk and Talk call be held with people that you interact with frequently at GitLab. It could be social in nature or focused on a specific problem/topic that needs to be discussed. If it’s a problem-solving focused discussion, the outcome should be captured in a merge request. It should not be used if the problem being discussed requires screen sharing or detailed note taking. There are great physical and mental health benefits to a walk and talk call. There are also benefits with increased focus and creativity . A Walk and Talk can also help prevent Zoom fatigue . The team members can use Zoom on their mobile device with the audio only function, or call one another from their preferred mobile device. A walk and talk call should be agreed to in advance to ensure that the local weather is compatible for a walk in both locations and that the walk and talk call fits into both team members’ schedules. We’ve created a Slack channel #walk-and-talk-meetings where, if you’d like, you can share pictures from your walking meetings. After GitLab releases a new version every month , we have a 30-minute call a few days later reflecting on what could have been better: We spend the first part of the retrospective meeting reviewing the action items from the previous month. On the 8th of each month (or the next business day), we have a kickoff meeting for the version that will be released in the following month. The product team and other leads will have already had discussions on what should be prioritized for that release. The purpose of this kickoff is to get everyone on the same page and to invite comments. Both the retrospectives and kickoffs are live streamed to our GitLab Unfiltered YouTube channel and posted to our Unfiltered YouTube channel . As GitLab continues to grow, sharing knowledge across the community becomes even more important. The Deep Dives page describes initiatives we are trying to encourage. This aligns with how we work since everything at GitLab is public by default . GitLab has a specific process to follow in crisis situations to ensure effective communications. Details can be found in the internal handbook . On 2022-01-20, the L&D team hosted Lorraine Lee for a live speaker series on video and presentation techniques in an all-remote workspace. Key points addressed in the training include: As you’re creating external or business content for GitLab, please refer to the GitLab Content Style Guide . For technical content, you can reference this word list . This list offers additional guidance for written communication at GitLab: Many times an explanation can be aided by a visual. Whenever presenting a diagram, we should still allow everyone to contribute. Where possible, take advantage of the handbook’s support for Mermaid . If you are new to using Mermaid or need help troubleshooting errors in your Mermaid code, the Mermaid Live Editor can be a helpful tool. Where taking advantage of Mermaid isn’t possible, link to the original in our Google Drive so that the diagram can be edited by anyone. At GitLab we use ubiquitous language to increase communication efficiency. This is defined in Domain-driven design as: “A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.” We use it for activities in GitLab, even ones not implemented in software. By having ubiquitous words to identify concepts we prevent confusion over what is meant, for example we refer to parts of our organization as a function, department, or group depending on exactly what is meant. Make sure that domains don’t overlap, for example organization size and deal size don’t reuse words to prevent overlap. If a term is ambiguous don’t use it, for example our hiring team uses the terms roles and vacancies , but avoid the ambiguous word job . Make sure that projects and working groups have clear and direct names. Prefer “CI Spend Reduction Working Group” to “Project Raven Working Group”. Make sure that people can infer as much as possible from the word, for example our subscription options allow you to know if someone is using self-managed or GitLab.com. Make sure terms don’t overlap without clearly defining how and why, for example see our tier definitions . Keep terms to one or at most two words to prevent people from introducing ambiguity by shortening a term. When using two words make the first word unique because people tend to drop the second word more often. MECEFU is an acronym for Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive Few words Ubiquitous-language. You pronounce it: MessiFu. Think of the great soccer player Lionel Messi and their kung fu or soccer fu skills. We want to use MECEFU terms to describe a domain to ensure efficient communication. MECEFU terms have 4 characteristics that help with efficiency: An example of a MECEFU term is our sales segmentation : One nit-pick is that the Medium of SMB and Mid of Mid-Market sound very similar. Simple Language is meant to encourage everyone at GitLab to simplify the language we use. We should always use the most clear, straightforward, and meaningful words possible in every conversation. Avoid using “fluff” words, jargon, or “corporate-speak” phrases that don’t add value. When you don’t use Simple Language, you: When you do use Simple Language, you: We’re now launching an optimization of our approach leveraging key learnings from the project’s postmortem. We’re creating a new plan based on what we learned from this project. Simple Language is important both when we’re speaking to other team members and when we’re representing GitLab to people outside the company. Be sure to use Simple Language in written communications as well. Our handbook, website, docs, marketing materials, and candidate or customer emails should be clear, concise, and effective. Corporate marketing maintains guidelines on GitLab’s tone of voice . For example, do not suggest that you’re “working in real-time” when a matter is in disarray. Convey that a lack of organization is hampering a result, and provide feedback and clear steps on resolving. Do not use a cool term such as “tiger team” when the existing term of “working group” is more exact. While cool terms such as these may be useful for persuading colleagues to join you in working towards a solution, the right way isn’t to use flowery language. The last example is when we used ‘Prioritizing for Global Optimization’ for what we renamed to headcount reset. When we renamed it we saw a good reduction in the use of this disruptive practice of moving people around. Using American English as our standard language supports our values such as efficiency, results, and transparency. Careful use of another person’s language can be a celebration of diversity and build an atmosphere of inclusion. The guidance in this section applies to written one-to-one communication, for example, merge request comments between an author and reviewer, not merge request descriptions or commit messages. Also keep the following in mind: Hey @nmalcolm, I left some suggestions for your merge request. Ka mau te wehi! (Te Reo Māori: great work / well done!) ありがとうございます (Japanese: thank you very much) for the review @cynthia! Avoid using Git in the naming of internal and external company related programs (BagGit, GitFit, Gitty, GitIt, etc.). Referencing Git creates an inaccurate perception that GitLab has a narrow focus. While GitLab started as a source control platform, it has become The DevOps Platform . We have a low internal email culture, as we see greater efficiency in other forms of communication (e.g. Slack). If you are emailing, please use the following guidelines: Use a bias for action to quickly move conversations that require collaboration and action out of Slack and into an issue. Only 90 days of Slack activity will be retained, so Slack should specifically NOT be used for: Internal Slack messages between team members are still considered professional communication. Please do not use or add emoji’s to Slack that are of a political, religious or of a sexual nature. You can refer to the Religion and politics at work section of the handbook. When in doubt do not use or add the emoji. If you have any concerns about an emoji that was used, please reach out to the author or if you are not comfortable doing so please reach out to your People Business Partner . There is a lot of information pertaining to Slack, as it is a critical part of GitLab’s communication. See the Slack tools and tips page . Note: We don’t use the term private message , because these direct messages are not inherently private like a phone call or private letter. The messages are potentially accessible by Workspace admins or via Backups. Slack refers to these types of messages as direct messages themselves . When using Slack for work-related purposes, please avoid direct messages. Direct messages discourage collaboration . You might actually be contacting the wrong person, and they cannot easily redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the moment, it is less efficient because other people cannot jump in and help. Use a public channel and mention the person or group you want to reach. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, involve other people if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed. If someone sends you a work-related direct message, it is okay to let them know you’d like to take the conversation to a public channel, linking to this section of the handbook. The process might look something like: If you find yourself getting a lot of direct messages that should go in a public channel, consider changing your Slack status to an attention grabbing emoji and set it to something like: If you must send a work-related direct message, don’t start a conversation with “Hi” or “Hey” as that interrupts their work without communicating anything. If you have a quick question, just ask the question directly, and the person will respond asynchronously. If you truly need to have a synchronous communication, then start by asking for that explicitly, while mentioning the subject. e.g., “I’m having trouble understanding issue #x, can we talk about it quickly?”. Use private channels instead of group direct messages. Group direct messages are very hard to maintain, track, and respond to. They also have a key limitation in that you can’t add people to the conversation. This is a hindrance to collaboration and transparency. Consider whether the conversation can take place in a public channel. If not, please use a private channel instead. This channel may have a short-term purpose. It is acceptable to leave the channel and/or archive it if you are no longer an active participant or the channel is no longer in use. As we grow headcount, we exponentially increase the lines of communication- 3 people have 3 communication lines, 4 have 6, and 41 have 820. As a result, there is a natural tendency for people to prefer private channels of communication. The intentions are good, as people are looking to reduce noise for others, but this can lead to the same problems as described elsewhere on this page, notably: Slack is our primary source of chat communication and is where many personal interactions happen. We want to continue to encourage folks to build personal relationships with one another which will often happen over DMs. Start by understanding what we mean by respecting time. We should err toward putting material into channels over DMs and public channels over private channels even though we understand that this will generate more messages that can be read by more people. Respecting time is not about reducing the overall volume of channel messages that team members receive. It’s about making sure that messages are targeted, expectations for asynchronous responses are clear, and we are communicating with consideration. The following tips provide ways to work respectfully with others given this context, though is not an exhaustive list: If you have a question that you can’t find the answer to in our handbook (or you need help finding something in the handbook) team members across the company are here to help. Go directly to the subject matter experts/source in the designated slack channel to ensure your question is addressed. If your question doesn’t relate to any of the existing topics: The times this feature would be used would be to comply with certain obligations. Corporate Export must be enabled by Slack in accordance with Slack’s policy, which can be found here . Examples of instances where GitLab may need to use this feature may include, but are not limited to, those situations listed in Slack’s documentation . No. The Slack Workspace Owner has the ability to export data from all direct messages and private channel conversations for the maximum retention period set by GitLab, which is currently set for 90-days. All messages that are older than 90-days cannot be exported by the Workspace Owner or any other Team Member at GitLab. While messages are not actively monitored, GitLab reserves the right to monitor its software for the reasons stated in its Employee Privacy Policy , including, but not limited to, the safety and protection of our Team Members, the protection of our intellectual property, and the exercise or defense of legal claims. Please keep GitLab values in mind when communicating directly with other team members. If you have a confidential personal issue that you do not feel comfortable discussing via a business-provided internal communications tool, it is recommended to use a personal form of communication such as a text message or phone call. For additional questions, please address in the issue . To use the “Slack Down!” group chat on Zoom: Once service is restored, go back to Slack. Once service is restored, go back to Zoom. Join the Slack Down! room on Hangouts Chat. Once service is restored, go back to Slack and Zoom. Never use a Google Doc / Presentations for something non-confidential that has to end up on the website or the handbook . Work on these edits via commits to a merge request. Then link to the merge request or diff to present the change to people. This prevents a duplication of effort and/or an out of date handbook. Google Docs can be useful when rapidly iterating /commenting/suggesting on the content, but if the content is meant to be long lived it should be moved to the handbook as an SSOT and deprecated with a link to the handbook page. If the content is short lived, e.g. one-time report that won’t be referred to beyond 2-3 weeks, it can remain in a Google Doc or presentation . Google Docs Pageless format is the preferred format for company documents that won’t be printed. If you set your default to Pageless then this will be applied to all future documents as well. If a document is likely going to be printed (for example, a contract) the older paged style is acceptable. See Good practices and helpful tips for help navigating the pageless format. If you do need a Google Doc, create one with your company Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) account and set the visibility, access controls and searchable flag according to the following guidelines. The recommended defaults when sharing a document for GitLab internal purposes is setting visibility to GitLab , access to Editor and searchable Can find in search results to ensure everyone can contribute! Note: To our knowledge, it is not possible to set the default to Can Edit and you have to change the permissions from View manually. We hope that Google adds this capability in the future. Reference Google’s documentation on Link Sharing to learn more. Pages like this are part of the handbook . The GitLab handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. GitLab Docs - docs.gitlab.com is where you can find documentation on GitLab, the product. repository / repositories are where files are kept under source code management . In most cases, requires MRs to merge. The Handbooks are in a repository, our code is in a repository, etc. README - README.md files are what are shown by default when you browse a repository. Contains useful information to give context on what the project/repository are for. These can also be used for user profiles as personal READMEs. We recommend you set your Google Calendar access permissions to ‘Make available for GitLab - See all event details’. Consider marking the following appointments as ‘Private’: There are several benefits and reasons to sharing your calendar with everyone at GitLab: If you add blocks of time spent on recurring tasks to your Google Calendar to remind yourself to do things (e.g. “Check Google Analytics”), consider marking yourself “Free” for those events so that coworkers know they may schedule a meeting during that time if they can’t find another convenient time. This feature allows you to create a link to an availability schedule that you can send to your customers or coworkers for them to schedule a call according to your availability. This allows you to only show available spots while keeping your other calls private. This also avoids having to go back and forth between you and other person figuring out what day and time works best for both of you. Since this is a native Google Calendar functionality, there is no need to set up integrations with your calendar like other scheduling tools. A member of our Customer Success team created a demo video of how to use this feature . Key practices to consider during any meeting are listed below. GitLab team members are not authorized to speak with the media or analysts on behalf of our company unless authorized by our Marketing department. Unless authorized, do not give the impression that you are speaking on behalf of GitLab in any communication that may become public. This includes posts to online forums, social media sites, blogs, chat rooms, and bulletin boards. This policy also applies to comments to journalists about specific matters that relate to our businesses, as well as letters to the editor and endorsements of products or services. For more, please visit the Corporate Communications handbook section . GitLab as the leader in all remote work creates opportunities for our team members to receive requests from external 3rd parties to participate on panels, blogs or news publication or articles. Recently our team members have been approached by external 3rd parties looking to pay or compensate GitLab team members for their time to discuss GitLab remote practice to help them guide a client. Other third parties may contact GitLab team members to provide subject matter expertise that they may have by virtue of their role at GitLab. As in any request we ask that team members verify who they are speaking with to make sure the source is indeed a valid and legitimate request. Always remember that you represent GitLab and if any question makes you uncomfortable or gives you a pause on whether you should answer then we recommend that you do not answer. A third party’s questions regarding GitLab financials, sales, compliance, executives or specifically where the company is heading should be treated with the most caution. We want and encourage all team members to be remote evangelists and this can be done without giving very specific information about GitLab. If you have any concern about a request please reach out on slack to #external-comms Please see our team member social media policy . See the YouTube page for options and instructions for posting recordings and live streaming to our YouTube channels. If you need to provide the details of GitLab’s contact information you can take the address from the visiting page for reference; or the mailing address of the office in the Netherlands if that is more applicable. If a phone number is required, leave this field empty by default. If that is not possible, then use the general number (+1-415-761-1791), but be aware that this number simply guides to a voice message that refers the caller back to contacting us via email. Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. In an all-remote organization effective communication is key to exchanging knowledge, ideas, and information.

    "paragraph": "Please see our company page for more general information about GitLab. At GitLab, our mission is simple: to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. Our platform doesn’t just bring people together—it unites teams and organizations, breaking down barriers and redefining what’s possible in software development. Here, you’re not just contributing to a tool, you’re shaping the future of secure, scalable software delivery. Our high-performance culture values collaboration, ownership, and impact, accelerating careers while driving global innovation. This is more than a job, it’s your opportunity to build something that matters. Our size and our mission (enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world.) mean that our team members can — and are expected to — make an impact across the company. Because we all use our product internally, you don’t have to be a developer to learn to collaborate in the GitLab tool. From your very first week, no matter your role, you’ll gain the technical skills needed to access, question, and contribute to projects far beyond your job description. This unique approach works because we’re a team of helpful, passionate people who want to see each other, the company, and the broader GitLab community succeed. We learn from each other, challenge each other, and thank each other. Come prepared to do meaningful work that will help shape the future of the company. While the opportunities to contribute are boundless in a growing organization like GitLab, they may not be clearly defined. You’ll need to think creatively, speak up to see how you can help, and be willing to try something new. At GitLab, our value of iteration has a unique impact on the way we operate and get things done. Working this way means our team members are expected to quickly deliver the minimal valuable change in their work instead of waiting to produce a polished, completed product. While this can be a challenging practice to adopt at first, it’s liberating to be able to make mistakes, get feedback quickly, and course correct to reach a better outcome, faster. As our company and the industry continue to grow, you’ll have the freedom to change and constantly evolve everything from your schedule and your workspace to your job description and your skills. Culture at GitLab is composed of three things."

    "title": "GitLab Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)",
    "paragraph": "At GitLab, our mission is to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. This, together with our values, is at the core of how we manage our business, including our approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”). Our all-remote team drives GitLab’s strategy and business results in more than 60 countries worldwide. In FY24, we sharpened our focus on our people by emphasizing the foundational role of high-performing teams and continuing to leverage our core value of diversity, inclusion, and belonging (DIB) to drive innovation and impact across our business. These efforts included launching new training and development programs and additional resources to encourage and enable team members to contribute and to give our people leaders more of the skills they need to manage efficient and effective teams. Our ESG strategy also encompasses efforts to minimize our environmental impact and better understand and address the potential effects of climate change on our business. In FY24, we continued to enhance our approach to measuring and reporting our greenhouse gas emissions. We conducted GitLab’s first climate risk assessment in alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and launched the first iteration of a supplier engagement program focused on improving the visibility of emissions in our supply chain. We are committed to good corporate governance and high standards of ethics and compliance. In particular, as we continue to harness the power of AI to enhance the GitLab platform, we recognize the importance of working within a robust framework of ethical principles and protecting our customers’ and users’ data. In early fiscal year 2025, we launched the GitLab AI Transparency Center, giving customers direct access to our AI Ethics Principles for Product Development, AI Continuity Plan, and AI features documentation so that they can adopt AI with confidence. Lastly, our strategy and mission are also bolstered by engagement with the wider GitLab community. In the last fiscal year, we continued to expand outreach and drive social impact through community programs such as GitLab for Startups, GitLab for Open Source, and GitLab for Education. We also launched GitLab for Nonprofits, which provides free GitLab licenses to registered nonprofit organizations that align with our values and ESG strategy. Our charitable efforts are further complemented by the GitLab Foundation, which supports people in growing their lifetime earnings through education, training, access to opportunities, and systems changes on a global scale. As ever, GitLab — the platform and the company — is made stronger by the support of our stakeholders, including our team members, customers, shareholders, and the wider community. I am thankful for the contributions so far and look forward to what we can accomplish together in the years ahead. GitLab Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer GitLab’s mission is to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. Our mission is the way we realize our purpose : to help people increase their lifetime earnings through access to opportunities and the DevSecOps platform. Our vision captures what we want to deliver to customers in the next 10 years. Today, GitLab is the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps platform. The DevSecOps Platform shift is part of a larger trend: teams of all types are realizing that breaking down silos has compounding effects on productivity and collaboration. We see it with data and operations teams creating DataOps; we see it with machine learning and ops teams creating MLOps. As more companies (and more teams within a company) rely on our platform, we are positioned to become the AllOps platform — a single application for all R&D. Our efforts are guided by our six core values of Collaboration, Results for Customers, Efficiency, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, Iteration, and Transparency. Together, they spell the CREDIT we give each other by assuming good intent. “With GitLab’s second ESG Report, we demonstrate our values of iteration and transparency, sharing how we continue to build on our approach to addressing the issues that matter most to our stakeholders and our business. One key example is the launch of our AI Transparency Center, underscoring how we are leveraging the power of AI within a clear framework of ethics, responsibility, and accountability. As our innovation continues to break down barriers, we recognize the increasing opportunity of integrating our business and sustainability strategies to create value for our customers, our shareholders, our team members, and the broader community.” – Robin Schulman , Chief Legal Officer, Head of Corporate Affairs, and Corporate Secretary GitLab’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Report includes information on our key ESG focus areas, our programs and policies, achievements to date, metrics and targets that help define our ESG program, and our plans for the future. Data about GitLab’s financial performance is not included in this report and may be found in our financial and SEC filings . Unless otherwise specified, the information included in this report was last updated on July 18, 2024. The content included covers Fiscal Year 2024 (“FY24”) (as of January 31, 2024) and we plan to update the report annually. Throughout the report, there may be mentions of Fiscal Year 2025 (“FY25”), which runs from February 1, 2024, through January 31, 2025. We would also like to note that GitLab maintains a public-facing handbook , pages of which are linked throughout the report. These pages are maintained separately and may reflect a different reporting period than this report. This report has been prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards released in October 2021 and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) Standard for Software & IT Services. We have also provided disclosures based on the framework of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). Content indexes for these standards are available in the Appendix . GitLab’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on the Board of Directors (“Board”) has reviewed the information in this report. For information on GitLab’s ESG Team, please visit the ESG handbook page . GitLab’s ESG strategy is driven by our values and deeply integrated into the company’s business philosophy. It reflects longstanding practices embedded in our work culture since GitLab’s inception, as well as updated policies and programs designed to meet the evolving needs and expectations of our stakeholders. The ESG Team creates and maintains GitLab’s ESG/sustainability strategy and programs. This includes creating and managing GitLab’s ESG disclosures and public ESG reports, identifying and prioritizing key issues to advance our social and environmental goals, and creating partnerships with nonprofit organizations that support GitLab’s values and mission. Our ESG strategy is informed by an understanding of the ESG topics that matter most to our business and our stakeholders. Completed in December 2022, our ESG materiality assessment included engagement with internal and external stakeholders and a focus on “double materiality,” exploring both topics that have the greatest impact on GitLab’s business, as well as the actual and potential impact of our activities on the environment, society, and our global communities. GitLab senior leadership — including members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of GitLab’s Board of Directors — were engaged as part of the assessment. The materiality assessment identified the following key ESG topics: We also include in this report other topics relevant to our business and stakeholders, including Community, Social Impact, and Corporate Governance. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”) provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. Our ESG efforts currently align with five of the 17 UN SDGs, and we seek to drive progress on the goals within our operations. We will continue to revisit and deepen our alignment as we make progress on our ESG strategy. We’re a team of helpful, passionate people who want to see each other, GitLab, and the broader GitLab community succeed. Our mission (to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers the world) means that our team members can — and are expected to — make an impact across the company. We empower them by cultivating a high-performance and results-driven culture — one that enables people to do their best work and advance their careers while fully contributing towards advancing GitLab’s business results. We hire, promote, and recognize those team members who best live our values . We also leverage team members’ unique skills and experiences to drive extraordinary outcomes. We believe that when team members seek feedback from a diverse group of peers and leaders, inside and outside of their group or function, they make better decisions and feel more connected. We work to make everyone feel welcome and increase the participation of underrepresented groups in our community and company. Our entire workforce is remote, making it easier for people of diverse backgrounds and abilities to join the team. As GitLab has evolved, we have learned a great deal about what it takes to build and manage a fully remote team, which we share through our publicly available handbook . Our approach to talent management is underscored by our values, particularly of transparency and diversity, inclusion, and belonging. It is also bolstered by the resources we provide to help our team members grow and succeed. Through our website and handbook , we are transparent about available positions , benefits , job descriptions , onboarding and offboarding procedures, facilitating connections with various internal groups, and much more. We also work to build a diverse team to drive extraordinary outcomes by expanding outreach and inclusivity initiatives to increase the number of team members and our Manager+ population who identify as part of an underrepresented group. Our People Group is dedicated to supporting each team member through their career journey at GitLab. They enable GitLab’s strategy through a focus on attracting and retaining diverse talent, creating a high-performance culture with a focus on efficiency and quality results, driving divisional success through talent programs, and cultivating an equitable and inclusive culture. This includes developing and maintaining our talent brand , facilitating ongoing learning and development , and providing resources for team members to connect , share concerns, and seek support . In FY24, we focused on accelerating GitLab’s 3-year strategy through re-emphasizing the foundational role of high-performing teams. At GitLab, high-performing teams: We educate team members about our values through trainings, videos , workshops, forums, certifications, and ambassadors, which are designed to reinforce our values as key drivers of our high-performance, results-driven culture. Managers at GitLab support our mission of enabling everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. We need to equip our people leaders with the skills to lead globally dispersed, all-remote teams to support our business growth at scale. Elevate is GitLab’s leadership training program for Managers and Senior Managers, which prepares managers with skills they need to build high-performing teams. In FY24, we certified 73% of our eligible Managers and Senior Managers in Elevate. Although this fell short of our goal of 85%—due to business-critical initiatives, some team members had to delay certification for a year—it demonstrated positive momentum for the program and contributed to the company’s strong performance throughout the year. During FY24, we also developed and launched additional tools to help participants deepen and continue their learning beyond initial certification. Elevate Applied is an ongoing resource that enables Managers and Senior Managers to connect with each other and practice, apply, and integrate concepts taught in Elevate in their day-to-day work at GitLab. In addition, we developed and announced the FY25 launch of Elevate+ , a six-month program designed to enable senior leaders (Directors and Senior Directors) to better understand and practice behaviors anchored in GitLab’s values and leadership competencies, develop new skills to support high-priority business needs, and help establish and strengthen cross-functional connections. We strive to foster a culture of continuous growth so that GitLab remains a great place to work. A positive impact on team member experience leads to a positive impact on results for GitLab and its customers. Our Talent Development team (commonly referred to as “Learning & Development’’) enhances team member performance, expands capabilities, and further develops skills that make GitLab team members the top talent in the industry. Our vision is to be recognized as a top organization for remote learning and development and to create a future where everyone contributes to a culture of curiosity. We accomplish this by focusing on skill-based learning, providing resources to enhance career mobility, and developing learning journeys for teams throughout the organization. To support our aim of facilitating accessible, remote-friendly development for all, we provide asynchronous access to learning opportunities, including: As a global, all-remote company with a team of diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, GitLab offers a dynamic environment and culture where everyone is encouraged to do their best work. Our talent brand empowers team members to share their thoughts on what it’s like to work here because their voices and stories make GitLab unique and successful. “By fully embracing the values, GitLab has changed the way I work. I have become more productive and satisfied with the work I do, while also having a better work-life balance. It’s motivating to work somewhere so amazing with such great people.” – Cynthia, Strategy and Operations, Office of the CEO We conduct a number of engagement surveys that enable us to capture honest feedback from our team members, understand engagement levels across the organization, and respond to changing needs. By making small iterations and moving quickly, we can get the data needed to evolve engagement programs as needed and align our priorities to the areas team members care about most. Our key survey tools include the annual CultureAmp Engagement survey, Employer Award surveys, and other ad hoc measures like Organizational Health surveys. In FY24, our Annual Engagement Survey reached 88% participation and indicated an overall engagement score of 75% favorable. This is 2% higher than our New Tech peer group, which gives us confidence in knowing we have a highly engaged team member community. Additional highlights included: Subsequently, our global year-end pulse survey demonstrated positive momentum with an overall engagement score of 79% favorable (+4%). In addition, 91% of participants said they’re proud to work at GitLab, while 86% rated GitLab as a great place to work. GitLab received Great Place to Work Certification for the 4th year in a row in May 2024 with 93% of its U.S. based team members saying that they believe GitLab is a great place to work. Great Place to Work recognizes companies for their outstanding workplace culture, benefits, and performance through successful completion of a survey for US-based team members and culture brief application. We are committed to a future where the Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (“DIB”) value empowers everyone to contribute. As a globally dispersed organization serving customers all over the world, we strive for a team that is representative of our users, an open and transparent work culture where all voices are heard and welcomed, and an environment where everyone can show up as their full selves and contribute to their best ability each day. We believe this not only makes GitLab a great place to work but also supports innovation and promotes better decision-making, helping us continue to deliver results for customers. Our DIB focus also extends to how we show up for people outside of GitLab, through initiatives that promote DIB in our industry and the broader community. To put it simply, we need the contributions of everyone in order to empower our team members, help our users change the world, and transform the industry. We do this through our A.D.A.P.T. strategy: Growing Our Talent & Their Experience Our team members are critical to our success. We provide pathways for them to thrive individually and as a part of the GitLab community. Level Up – Our learning platform is designed to deploy learning content across GitLab internal team members. Career development and mobility – We provide resources and direction to help team members engage in lifelong growth to meet their unique career goals. Team Member Resource Groups (TMRGs) – TMRGs cultivate an inclusive workplace and empower our employees by fostering a supportive environment where everyone can thrive. Our TMRGs are open to all team members, not just those who specifically identify with a particular group. Team Member Advocacy Groups (TMAGs) – TMAGs are groups that share common interests and work together to drive change on behalf of the community through education, action, and enablement across a specific need. From education to mentorship, sponsorship, and advocacy, GitLab educates its leaders, provides resources for its team members, and holds its leaders accountable so that team members feel empowered to utilize the community they are surrounded by every day. Equipping Our People Leaders – Our leadership training ensures that DIB is considered and threaded throughout the team member experience. Community partnerships are a great way for GitLab to engage with the community externally, provide opportunities for career development and networking for our team members, and also add layers of DIB to key areas of our organization. Partnerships are also how we measure our inclusive practices against industry standards and can act as accountability partners in achieving success. External Engagement – We sponsor and support events worldwide that promote inclusion and belonging, and create learning and growth opportunities for our team. By networking with diverse talent at these events, we infuse our team with fresh perspectives and ideas. Reflecting on a year of impactful partnerships, we are inspired to further foster spaces where technology and diverse talent converge, giving everyone a voice. Do Good – Throughout the year, the DIB and ESG teams collaborate to give back to the communities we serve by offering volunteer opportunities to team members, working with TMRGs to donate funds to relevant nonprofits, and providing in-kind donations to DIB related nonprofits through the GitLab for Nonprofits program. When we think about DIB, it’s easy to see it only from a team member perspective. Our goal is to bring inclusivity into as many touch points as possible — from our open source contributors to how we engage with our customers and users. DEI Project Badging Program – In FY24, GitLab partnered with the Linux Foundation through the Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software ( CHAOSS ) project to enable open source projects to signal their focus on building and growing diverse communities. Digital Accessibility – At GitLab, we build understanding, empathy, and allyship around accessibility. We do this through various methods internally, including Inclusive Design Principles , Digital Accessibility Training, webinars, and workshops, to ensure that our Product and Engineering teams are equipped with the skills necessary to make our product more accessible. Inclusive Hiring – GitLab strives to create an equitable application, interview, selection, and offer process for all candidates to ensure we’re building a diverse and inclusive workforce around the globe as the company continues to grow. DIB Working Group – A strategic group of impactful team members who collaborate to drive action and results in support of DIB. This includes promoting inclusive practices in areas such as name pronunciation, pronoun education, and meeting etiquette in an all-remote workplace. We followed through on our commitments and accomplished a lot in 2023, but we still have work to do. We are continuing to build DIB into every part of GitLab – both internally with our team members and externally with our customers, users, partners, and open source community. We have committed to four key objectives in FY25: Deliver our supplier diversity strategy – We have set an aspirational goal to double the number of suppliers categorized as diverse. To achieve this aspirational goal, we are engaging partners, strategically embedding diversity, inclusion and belonging practices into our procurement process, and evaluating our current suppliers’ practices in line with applicable anti-discrimination principles. Increase representation – Extend our representation of team members from our Disabilities, Neurodivergence and LGBTQIA+ communities. We are working with several partners to help us achieve this goal including but not limited to, Unicorns in Tech, DisabilityIN, and Anita B. Org. Visit this Handbook page to learn more about how we select partners and measure success in attracting team members from these communities. Emerging Talent @ GitLab – Our mission is to attract, acquire, and activate talent to unlock their potential, connecting learning agility with employment opportunities, decoupled from academic-based prerequisites. This is anchored on the belief that building a balanced workforce will enable GitLab to scale effectively and inclusively, and that building a strong foundation today will greatly impact our future growth. Ensure inclusive leadership – Inclusive leadership is integrated into leadership development experiences and offered as voluntary resources to promote ongoing education and awareness. These experiences span all front-line and aspiring leaders in addition to VP and E-Group populations. From the beginning, GitLab has been an open source project made possible by contributions from its community. Contributors to GitLab — the platform and the company — make up the GitLab community and are fundamental to GitLab’s strategy and mission. The Developer Relations team supports GitLab’s mission by working with our community to ensure they receive support and recognition for contributing to GitLab. This involves a multifaceted approach that includes creating educational content, organizing events and workshops, developing programs, and providing platforms for knowledge exchange and collaboration. The team focuses not only on promoting GitLab’s features and capabilities but also on actively listening to and incorporating feedback from our community to inform product development and improvements. GitLab’s Strategy Programs aim to put GitLab’s most powerful features in the hands of communities that may not otherwise have the means to access them, helping them to grow and thrive. Members of the Strategy Programs team serve as liaisons, tracking the ways their respective communities prefer using GitLab and translating that knowledge into insights that help GitLab create a better product. While each program is unique in its organization and execution, benefits may include: Our key community programs include the following: For information on GitLab for Nonprofits, see Social Impact below. Finding an open source community to learn, connect, and grow with can be a challenge for many developers. To better align on best practices for building inclusive open source communities and to ensure that our DIB value is reflected in our contributor community, GitLab has partnered with the CHAOSS project to integrate GitLab with their recently released DEI Project Badging program . The DEI Project Badging program enables open source projects to: To learn more about how the program works and how GitLab and CHAOSS worked together to bring it to the wider community, see our blog post . In FY24, our Contributor Success Team sought to enhance community relations and contribute to sustainability by allowing teams to recognize contributors by sponsoring tree planting in lieu of traditional rewards like swag. Through a partnership with Tree-Nation , we have the ability to plant trees on behalf of others, and others can also pay to plant trees in our forest. Similarly, our Marketing team offers attendees at GitLab events the opportunity to plant trees through Rewards.Earth . Launched in 2023, GitLab’s Philanthropy Policy supports GitLab teams that want to engage in charitable giving and activities benefiting registered nonprofit organizations that align with GitLab’s mission, values, and ESG strategy. By enabling teams to contribute to causes aligned with their work, we foster connections between GitLab’s purpose and values and the opportunity to drive impact in the broader community. For example, in FY24: During FY24, we also launched our in-kind donation program, GitLab for Nonprofits , which gives free GitLab licenses to registered nonprofit organizations that align with our values and ESG strategy. Nonprofits accepted into the program are provided a free Ultimate license for one year for up to 20 seats. In the first six months of the program, we granted licenses to more than 100 qualified nonprofits. “GitLab is our canvas for workflow across our nonprofit organization. It allows us to do everything from planning and managing the workloads for our teams all the way to the CI/CD pipelines, which automate efforts ranging from routine tasks to platform deployments in our various environments. Whether it’s documenting processes in place with issue templates or structuring organization-wide initiatives with interdependent issues, epics, and milestones, GitLab gives us the structure we need, with the flexibility to meet our unique needs.\" –Mike Bowie, Chief Technology Officer, Last Mile Through our GiveLab program , we encourage team members to take part in volunteer initiatives that support and ultimately uplift their local communities. In FY24, GitLab provided virtual volunteer opportunities for team members through a partnership with SuitUp , a nonprofit that equips students for life beyond the classroom by partnering with schools/youth organizations and businesses to develop, organize, and implement engaging educational competitions in communities across the U.S. and beyond. “We extend our heartfelt gratitude to GitLab for their invaluable partnership with SuitUp in 2023. GitLab’s commitment to youth education has not only paved a clear pathway for our students’ success, but has opened abundant opportunities for their development in STEM careers and beyond. We are deeply thankful to the GitLab team for their dedication and the transformative impact they have had on the lives and futures of our SuitUp students across the globe.” –Kelsey English Smith, SuitUp’s Interim Chief Executive Officer GitLab is dedicated to supporting charitable organizations with missions that align with our company’s values through the GitLab Foundation. Established in 2022, the GitLab Foundation focuses on supporting people to grow their lifetime earnings through education, training, access to opportunities, and systems change on a global scale. Its vision is a world in which one million more people can afford a better life. The GitLab Foundation is funded by GitLab and its co-founder, Sid Sijbrandij. When GitLab went public in 2021, the Board approved a 1% share donation to capitalize the GitLab Foundation. In FY24, 1,635,545 shares of Class A common stock were registered to be issued to the GitLab Foundation. The GitLab Foundation is an independent nonprofit entity and its operations are autonomous from GitLab. To learn more, please visit the GitLab Foundation . Around the world, many communities are already experiencing climate impacts such as warmer temperatures, more frequent severe weather events, and changes in water availability and other vital ecosystem services. With this in mind, GitLab is committed to doing our part to minimize our environmental footprint, including working to reduce GHG emissions associated with our operations. As a fully remote company, GitLab has no Scope 1 (direct) emissions or Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity for company-owned facilities, meaning that 100% of our footprint comes from Scope 3 emissions. Our FY24 GHG inventory measures emissions associated with purchased goods and services (which includes cloud services), capital goods, employee commuting (which includes remote work), business travel, and investments (as defined under Category 15 of the GHG Protocol). Our emissions increased in FY24 partially due to improvements in our methodology. For FY24, we estimated emissions using the Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA), a multi-regional economic and environmental database, as it better reflects the global nature of supply chains, helping capture differences in emissions profiles that vary significantly from one country to another. We also expanded our measurement to include emissions from investments (as defined under Category 15 of the GHG Protocol). More detailed results of our inventory are available in the Performance Data Table . Our third-party assurance letter of our FY24 GHG inventory is available here . In FY24, we took steps to further understand our climate impacts and advance the development of a formal emissions reduction strategy. This included initiating GitLab’s first climate risk assessment, to help us better understand climate-related risks and opportunities for our business. For more information on our climate risk assessment and scenario analysis, please see our TCFD Index . In FY24, we also launched a supplier engagement program with a focus on climate. As an initial step, we engaged our top 20 suppliers by spend who are not currently disclosing emissions data, asking them to start measuring their emissions and sharing the data publicly. We will be expanding the scope of the engagement to include more suppliers in FY25. In FY25, we will continue working to establish GHG emissions reduction targets. We have also launched the first iteration of a team member sustainability guide with the goal of educating GitLab team members on how to be more sustainable. In January 2024, GitLab purchased and retired carbon removal credits worth 8,580 tonnes of CO2e. The purchase funds a reforestation program called Trees for Global Benefits, a long-running cooperative carbon offsetting program that combines community-led activities to increase carbon sequestration, encourage sustainable land-use practices, and provide farmers with performance-based payments. We also retired additional credits worth 877 tonnes of CO2e that were purchased in FY23. GitLab is strongly committed to good corporate governance practices, which provide an important framework within which our Board and executive leadership can pursue our strategic objectives for the benefit of our shareholders. The Board’s duty is to serve as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and to oversee the management of the company’s business. To fulfill its responsibilities and discharge its duty, the Board follows the procedures and standards set forth by GitLab’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and other governance documents . Board members’ responsibilities include: The Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The composition and responsibilities of each committee are described in our Proxy Statement and in the Investor Relations section of our website. Board committees oversee and review areas of risk that are particularly relevant to them based on their responsibilities and charters. GitLab’s management regularly provides reports to support the Board’s oversight obligations. This reporting cadence provides visibility and information regarding the identification, assessment, and management of critical risks and the company’s risk mitigation strategies. The charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee tasks the committee with assisting the Board in overseeing company programs relating to corporate responsibility and sustainability, including ESG matters. GitLab’s Senior Director, ESG, reports to the Chief Legal Officer (who is also the Head of Corporate Affairs and Corporate Secretary) weekly and to GitLab’s executive leadership as needed. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets at least twice per year and ESG topics are discussed with this committee as well as with the full Board as needed. At GitLab, we recognize that to maintain trust and deliver the world’s leading DevSecOps platform, security and privacy must remain our top priorities. Our information security and privacy practices reflect our dedication to safeguarding customer data and building security into the core of our product and our company. The GitLab Security Division’s mission is to enable everyone to innovate and succeed on a safe, secure, and trusted DevSecOps platform. As part of this mission, the Security Assurance Department is responsible for monitoring and reporting on GitLab’s compliance with various security frameworks and standards and for providing GitLab customers with a high level of assurance around the security of GitLab Cloud Services, which is comprised of GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated. To help ensure that user information is protected, we employ a range of administrative, technical, and physical security controls. For more information on our security practices, please see our Technical and Organizational Security Measures for GitLab Cloud Services. We maintain various security certifications covering GitLab Cloud Services, including ISO/IEC 27001:2013, ISO/IEC 27017:2015, and ISO/IEC 27018:2019. In FY24, we expanded our compliance portfolio to include a SOC 2, Type II report for GitLab Dedicated and added TISAX AL-2 certification for GitLab Cloud Services. In January 2024, we enhanced customer access to assurance resources with the launch of the updated GitLab Trust Center . The Trust Center provides a single, unified location for communicating our compliance and assurance credentials, hosting our security and privacy documentation for customer consumption, sharing important notices, and hosting our internal knowledge base where customers can readily access the same answers we provide in questionnaire responses. This self-service approach not only provides customers with increased visibility of critical information but also enables them to accomplish security and risk reviews quickly and efficiently. GitLab’s cybersecurity program was designed in alignment with industry standards and recognized best practices to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. Identified risks are assessed for criticality, prioritized for remediation, and reported by GitLab’s security teams to various levels of our management. Our global incident response team iteratively evaluates security events for impact, using both qualitative and quantitative factors. Security incidents that are assessed as potentially material are escalated to designated members of our senior management and Board, as applicable. Our security program also accounts for potential cybersecurity risks associated with third parties with whom we do business. These risks are continually assessed throughout the vendor lifecycle, from onboarding to offboarding. We also engage in continuous monitoring of our cybersecurity risks and perform security assurance activities via independent, external third parties such as consultants, auditors, and assessors during our robust security certification audits, penetration tests, and bug bounty programs. The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity threats, including compliance with disclosure requirements and related effects on financial and other risks, and it reports any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board for consideration. Management is responsible for and regularly discusses identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis through programs led by the Chief Information Security Officer, the Chief Legal Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer. For more information, see our FY24 Form 10-K and our GitLab Trust Center . GitLab is fully committed to protecting the personal data of its customers, team members, suppliers, and other stakeholders in accordance with global comprehensive data privacy laws. We take the privacy of personal data very seriously and have initiated a variety of methods and controls so that we know what data we collect and hold and that it is protected appropriately. Our Privacy Statement provides details on how we collect, share, use, and protect personal information and on the choices that customers and users have regarding their personal data. Users also have the right to access, correct, restrict, or delete personal data and to port personal data to another company. Although legal and regulatory requirements related to data privacy may vary by jurisdiction, GitLab provides users with the same rights and choices no matter where they live. For more information on our privacy practices, see our Privacy Statement . The Privacy Team (part of GitLab’s Legal and Corporate Affairs Team) provides support and guidance to uphold consistent business processes around the protection of personal data. Privacy Team members collaborate cross-functionally and serve as advocates to ensure that the data privacy practices of GitLab meet the needs of our cross-functional partners and are continually balanced with an ever-changing global data privacy and protection landscape. The GitLab Data Classification Standard defines data categories and provides a matrix of security and privacy controls for the purposes of determining the level of protection to be applied to GitLab data throughout its lifecycle. As part of our commitment to privacy, GitLab ensures that, where appropriate, projects and personal data processing activities are subject to Privacy Reviews and a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as key components of a ‘Privacy by Design’ approach. GitLab’s product mission is to consistently create products and experiences that users love and value. We believe this includes our responsibility to design inclusive products that aim to provide access to content and functionality that enables consumption and contribution from everyone. Our product principles guide us in developing products consistent with the approach of other world-class product organizations. We strive to set an example by empowering our wider GitLab community to build and work with the highest levels of security through our DevSecOps platform. This extends to how we are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and continuously evolving the platform to enable secure, responsible development. GitLab is dedicated to responsibly building artificial intelligence (AI) into and throughout our comprehensive DevSecOps platform. We offer GitLab Duo, a full suite of AI capabilities across the GitLab platform so that our customers can ship better, more secure software faster. GitLab Duo follows a privacy- and transparency-first approach to help customers confidently adopt AI while keeping their valuable assets protected. As we work to integrate new AI-powered features into the platform, we do not simply adopt the latest advancements for their own sake. Instead, we take a strategic, intentional approach , ensuring that the features we add have a clear purpose, appropriate controls, and safeguards to protect users’ data. This includes a policy not to use customers’ or users’ AI inputs to train any language models without their instruction or prior consent. In early 2024, we launched the GitLab AI Transparency Center to enable our customers to confidently unlock the enormous potential of AI and emphasize our customer-centric approach to responsible AI development and deployment. The AI Transparency Center currently includes GitLab’s AI Ethics Principles for Product Development , AI Continuity Plan , and AI features documentation . The principles and policies in our AI Transparency Center govern how we responsibly select AI models to use based on an extensive model evaluation process. The launch of the center was a cross-functional effort led by the Legal and Corporate Affairs (LACA) team in partnership with the Product, Security, and Marketing teams. Our commitment to responsible product development also encompasses how we support customers in ensuring security and responsibility throughout the software development lifecycle. GitLab’s security and governance capabilities include a wide range of controls, such as automatic scanning of project dependencies for security vulnerabilities, license compliance, and other risks; vulnerability management and security scanning; security and compliance policies; and comprehensive anti-abuse tools. In FY24, we introduced several enhancements, including support for custom roles , expanded security policies , improved security scanner accuracy, and support for group-level dependency lists for centralized dependency management. The incorporation of end-to-end continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) features in GitLab supports the default integration of best practices, empowering users to focus on developing code with speed, security, and quality in mind. This includes automated code testing capabilities that make software development easier, faster, and less risky for developers. In FY24, we continued to enhance GitLab’s CI/CD offering with new features such as components , preconfigured CI/CD files that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications, and expanded runner machine types to enable faster CI/CD pipelines. We also improved key GitLab features such as variables and secrets , helping users make more informed decisions about their data and application security while also supporting the best practices in design and secure workflows. GitLab is committed to the highest standards of legal and ethical business conduct. It has long operated its business consistent with operating principles and policies that reinforce this commitment. GitLab complies with all laws and regulations that are applicable to its activities and expects all team members to adhere to our ethical standards and legal and regulatory obligations. These expectations are reflected and reinforced by our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”) and various supporting policies, procedures, and other resources (collectively, “Compliance Standards”). In FY24, we centralized our compliance efforts. The Ethics and Compliance Program , is designed to help GitLab team members maintain its culture of compliance and to promote ethical decision-making by: The Board, through its Audit Committee, is responsible for administering the Code of Conduct, and for addressing material issues and risks concerning Compliance Standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Audit Committee has delegated day-to-day responsibility for administering and interpreting the Code of Conduct to GitLab’s Chief Legal Officer. Each team member is responsible for reading, understanding, and ultimately complying with GitLab’s Compliance Standards. Team members are expected to deal honestly, ethically, and fairly with customers, partners, suppliers, competitors, and other third parties. GitLab expressly prohibits team members from violating applicable laws and regulations, and any team member who does so may face disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal (subject to local law). To memorialize and reinforce GitLab’s expectations, we require each team member to review and acknowledge our Code of Conduct on an annual basis. Team members are educated on GitLab’s policies and procedures and related laws and regulations through continuous training, both at onboarding and throughout the year, and awareness campaigns. Team members are encouraged to ask questions about our policies and seek guidance when necessary through various avenues, including a Slack channel dedicated to ethics and compliance. GitLab strives to foster a work environment in which ethical issues and concerns may be raised and discussed with supervisors or others without fear of retribution . If a team member becomes aware of a suspected or actual violation of law, regulation, or GitLab Compliance Standards, they have a responsibility to promptly report their concern in accordance with GitLab’s Whistleblower Policy and Code of Conduct. GitLab offers team members a variety of ways to report suspected or actual violations. Team members may raise their concerns orally or in writing to their direct supervisor or manager, to GitLab’s Chief Legal Officer, or to the Audit Committee. At any time, team members may also submit reports using EthicsPoint, a GitLab-provided tool that is available 24 hours a day and allows for anonymous reporting about conduct addressed in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Reports to EthicsPoint can be submitted using a toll-free hotline or through the EthicsPoint website . In addition to EthicsPoint, GitLab has engaged Lighthouse Services to provide an anonymous hotline for team members to submit reports involving team member relations. GitLab treats all reports seriously. Notification of reports submitted via EthicsPoint is automatically provided to the Chief Legal Officer and Chairperson of the Audit Committee and those reports are promptly and thoroughly investigated by qualified personnel at the direction of the Chief Legal Officer, as appropriate. Reports involving team member relations are reported to the People Group team. GitLab’s commitment to legal and ethical conduct extends to its suppliers, contractors, resellers, agents, and consultants (collectively, “Partners”). GitLab expects all Partners, their employees, sub-suppliers, and any other party involved in the execution of GitLab work to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and the standards set forth in GitLab’s Partner Code of Ethics , which includes standards relating to ethical conduct, including human rights and labor, health and safety, bribery and corruption, environmental impacts, and more.

    "title": "Office of the CEO",
    "paragraph": "GitLab is a functionally organized company in which functions are as mutually exclusive as possible to be efficient. Without a COO or central operating department reporting into the CEO, the CEO gets leverage through an Office of the CEO (OCEO for short) led by the Chief of Staff (CoS) to the CEO. While the Chief of Staff to the CEO is not a part of GitLab’s executive team, this senior person reports directly to the CEO and manages a team that supports the CEO and/or cross-functional projects of importance to GitLab. Help the CEO be more effective and lead select cross-functional initiatives of importance to GitLab. The Office to the CEO consists of: When there are gaps, the Office may expand to include additional roles and responsibilities. For example, at times this Office has included our TeamOps initiative, internal communications , and handbook maintenance . As GitLab is a functionally organized company, the goal in most cases is to own an area until another function is prepared to own and support it. The size of the team and which positions are present have varied over time depending on CEO priorities and required resources. For a list of current OCEO team members, please refer to the company team page . Given the cross-functional nature of the company goals and given these projects are important to the CEO, the Strategy and Operators team members are often involved in these initiatives. The Chief of Staff to the CEO and their team may work on projects that fit any combination of the following: This is not an exhaustive list of the types of work the Office of the CEO might do. GitLab is a functional organization , which means the people are organized by function . When a cross-functional project arises between multiple different Departments, Office of the CEO team members may be included to help with the planning and execution. In many cases, a member of the Office of the CEO will be the directly responsible individual (DRI) for the project. Whether it’s a product feature proposal, a new initiative roll-out, or questions from the board, the Office of the CEO is the group that can be trusted to get things done, get them done quickly, and get them done right. Examples of a cross-functional project: Projects come up that are both important and under-resourced. The Strategy and Operations team members within the Office of the CEO should be known for its ability to become 80% effective on any subject quickly. They are generalists at their core and, while they bring special skills to the table, they are meant to be able to address important problems as they come up. A member of the Office of the CEO might help source candidates for a strategic hire, fix grammatical errors in the handbook, and build a financial model all in the same day based on what is important or top of mind for the CEO at a given point. The team helps with work that other teams may not have the bandwidth to do but is important to the organization and/or the CEO. Examples of an under-resourced project: There may be projects with no clear leader for a myriad of reasons, including that we’re still hiring the point person or the lead is on leave. Because of the team’s ability to come up to speed quickly, they may be tasked with something totally out of their domain with the expectation that they bring their leadership experience to the table, will do the work to make good decisions, and will lean on team members who are subject-matter experts. For example, there has historically been no DRI for the handbook or related content sites . As it became clear that this was a GitLab priority, but no function planned to prioritize this within the coming year, the Office of the CEO stepped in to take on handbook ownership until an owner could be identified. Examples of projects with no clear leader: Some projects or initiatives are very broad and cross-functional and make sense to belong to the CEO but would be inefficient uses of the CEO’s time if fully owned by the CEO. The Office of the CEO is the shepherd for these sorts of projects and collaborates with all team members at GitLab to achieve success on such initiatives. The CEO will have other projects that come up that they will task the Office of the CEO with, such as following up on something or carrying on a conversation on their behalf. Examples of tasks or initiatives that are important to the CEO: Many of the tasks are quick asks: handbook MRs, formatting changes, or questions to be answered. Small asks should be handled as quickly as possible. Other asks, such as OKR-related planning or an initiative that requires alignment with multiple stakeholders, require forethought and more appropriate timing. Some amount of time each week needs to be spent moving these sorts of tasks forward. As a rule, everything in the doc is a TODO for the Office of the CEO. When tasks are DONE, they should be labeled as such. The CEO will review and delete the item once it’s been assessed as completed. Since the team has limited capacity to lean into everything that it may want or be asked to, it is thoughtful about team and individual capacity. Members of the Office of the CEO will be expected to manage both directed and leadership (largely self-directed) work. You can find definitions and examples of directed and leadership work on the CoS to the CEO handbook page . When newly initiated, self-directed, leadership work entails a significant time commitment (>20% capacity for more than a week), the work being done should be flagged to the CEO in a 1:1 or team meeting. This work should stay on the 1:1 agenda between the CoS to the CEO and the team member for the duration of the activity. If needed, activities may be reprioritized based on top demands and priorities. More senior roles within the Office of the CEO can expect to have more leadership than directed work, but all roles should have a mix within a fiscal year. Office of the CEO members should monitor the mix of directed and leadership work that they are doing and provide as appropriate in Office of the CEO Meetings, so the CoS to the CEO and CEO are aware of the current balance and can make adjustments, if needed. While there are rare exceptions, members of the Office of the CEO are not forever owners of initiatives. They plug in to help achieve critical milestones or fill gaps. When a member of the Office of the CEO joins an initiative, there should be agreement from key stakeholders around: Office of the CEO members can be reassigned based on the needs of the business and priorities of the CEO. In most cases, a member of the Office of the CEO will remain with a project until the exit criteria for the Office of the CEO is achieved. If a project extends beyond its anticipated timeframe or priorities change, a member may have to leave a project before the agreed upon exit criteria is achieved. When a member of the Office of the CEO exits an ongoing initiative they will: There may be instances in which the Office of the CEO leaving leads to a project scope being reduced or deprioritized. In these instances, the Office of the CEO member will be responsible for engaging key stakeholders around the keep/expand scope or go/no-go decision. It will be clearly documented and key folks will be involved in the decision and aware of the outcome. The executives get together every quarter for the e-group offsite . The CoS to the CEO plays an important role . It’s 3 to 4 days long with a Functional Leaders Meeting within the following days. There are recurring discussion topics as well as a discussion on content chosen by the CEO. In addition, the CoS to the CEO is responsible for preparing the CEO for offsites by: Functional Leaders is a group comprised of all CEO-Skips , select People Business Partners, and a few other folks as nominated by members of E-Group. The CoS to the CEO enables and manages this group. A member of the Office of the CEO is the DRI within GitLab for the success of GitLab’s partnership with JiHu . Coordination with JiHu requires engagement from multiple functions within GitLab. The Office of the CEO ensures that the appropriate folks are engaged at the right times and that GitLab provides appropriate support to this separate entity. For example, this member ensures that there is an aligned process among relevant GitLab functions after a customer requests to transit to JiHu : Due to its cross-functional scope and access to information, the Office of the CEO is uniquely positioned to see what is happening across the company. Members of the Office of the CEO are encouraged to regularly have coffee chats with folks outside of the team and share key insights and feedback from these conversations. We are evaluating different ways to measure our success as a team. These include: The Chief of Staff to the CEO may occasionally have a Chief of Staff Shadow, a GitLab team member who will participate in a specific project or initiative for a fixed time. Depending on the project or initiative, the team member may spend most of their time with an Office of the CEO team member instead. Shadow responsibilities could include: taking notes, providing feedback, and/or supporting the overall initiative success. This role would be in addition to any existing responsibilities at GitLab. Participants would opt in to experience another function within GitLab and contribute to a different part of the business. Since participation would be in addition to an existing workload, managers must sign off before a CoS to the CEO Shadow can participate. Interested team members can share their interest with the Chief of Staff to the CEO in the #ceo-chief-of-staff-team Slack channel. The CoS to the CEO will follow up with you to understand what you are looking to get out of the experience and review projects that may be a good match. If there is not an existing project, you will be kept in mind for future opportunities. Once a project or initiative to Shadow has been identified and the team member decides to participate, the team member should open a merge request to add their name to the below table. The MR should be shared through Slack in the #ceo-chief-of-staff-team channel for review and merge. Optionally, the team member can make use of the internship for learning as a framework to guide the Shadow period. The Office of the CEO maintains a GitLab Group and Google Group to ensure the appropriate level of access is granted or removed as team members join and leave the team. The following mapping of permission levels from GitLab Groups to Google Groups is being used: There is no automatic syncing between these groups so Office of the CEO team members who have the appropriate permission level in each group should add or remove team members as they join and leave the team. The primary project used by the Office of the CEO to track work specific to our team is Office of the CEO . Please file issues here as needed to track work being done."

    "title": "Anti-Harassment Policy",
    "paragraph": "Per the stated Roles & Responsibilities , changes to this page must be approved or merged by a code owner. All contributions are welcome and encouraged. Everyone at GitLab has a responsibility to prevent and stop harassment. Working remotely means that the majority of our interactions are by video call or written communication, such as email or shared documents. The exceptions to this are team summits, attending conferences together, and local team meetups. No matter the method of communication, it is expected that everyone will contribute to an inclusive and collaborative working environment and respect each other at all times. Team member behavior is not limited to internal interactions with each other. Our Anti-harassment policy applies to GitLab team members interaction with customers, vendors and community members. Should you become aware of or witness any form of harassment or behavior that violates this policy or our company values , please report the incident directly to the Chief People Officer, Team Member Relations , or a People Business Partner immediately for thorough investigation. GitLab is a global organization and our team is distributed all over the world, so we strive to ensure our team is fully aligned with GitLab’s no tolerance harassment policy despite their location. We want everyone to feel confident and comfortable communicating concerns. GitLab respects, appreciates, understands and supports every aspect of diversity. We aim to continuously foster a globally aware team. This policy applies to all team members of GitLab, whether contractor or employee, in all locations. There are local labor laws in every country and in the case of the United States, state laws, that must be followed when handling, reporting and investigating incidents of harassment. The People Business Partner team and legal counsel, if required, in each of those countries will be called upon to ensure compliance and the appropriate legal processes and procedures are followed. Specific country requirements for employees (subject to changes in employment law) are listed in the Country & US State-Specific Requirements section and will be updated regularly. All individual contributors, managers, and leaders will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, for any act of harassment they commit. The following are considered forms of harassment and will not be tolerated by GitLab: Sexual harassment is considered unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is sufficiently persistent or offensive enough to interfere with the receiver’s job performance or create an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. Sexual harassment encompasses a wide range of conduct. Examples of misconduct include, but may not be limited to, the following actions: Sexual harassment is unlawful and is considered a form of team member misconduct. Sanctions will be enforced against individuals engaging in sexual harassment and against supervisory and managerial personnel who knowingly allow such behavior to continue. Any retaliation against an individual who complains of sexual harassment or who testifies or assists in any proceeding under the law is unlawful. Having a diverse workforce, made up of team members who bring a wide variety of skills, abilities, experiences and perspectives, is essential to our success. We are committed to the principles of equal opportunity, inclusion, and respect. All employment-related decisions must be based on company needs, job requirements, and individual qualifications. Always take full advantage of what our team members have to offer; listen and be inclusive. We do not tolerate discrimination against anyone, including team members, customers, business partners, or other stakeholders. Any form of discrimination towards an individual is strictly prohibited, including: Report suspected discrimination right away and never retaliate against anyone who raises a good faith belief that unlawful discrimination has occurred. If you believe you have been discriminated against or witnessed discriminatory practices, please contact the Chief People Officer, a People Business Partner , or the Team Member Relations Specialist to initiate an investigation into the behavior. GitLab has also engaged Lighthouse Services to provide anonymous reporting methods, as described in the How to Report Violations section. GitLab does not tolerate violent acts or threats of violence. The company will not tolerate fighting, bullying, coercion, or use of abusive or threatening words directed to, about, or against a co-worker, lead, manager, executive, candidate, client/customer, vendor, contributor, or any other person. No individual employed by GitLab should commit or threaten to commit any violent act or discuss committing such offenses, even in a joking manner. Retaliation of any sort for filing a claim of harassment will not be tolerated. If you believe you have been retaliated against, please contact the Chief People Officer, Team Member Relations or a People Business Partner to initiate an investigation. If someone messes up, people are encouraged to speak up publicly and within the moment, in order to let that person and others know that what happened was not inclusive behavior. This makes for a situation from which all parties can learn, and is one which promotes understanding. Additionally it makes it possible for that person to de-escalate the situation by correcting themselves and apologizing. This does not ensure there will be no consequences. However, it will greatly reduce the chance of escalation and has the potential to help a situation become comfortable and inclusive again. If a threat is made against you or someone else that makes you or another team member question their safety due to an issue, merge request, email or other work related matters do not hesitate to initiate the following process: If managers become aware of misconduct, they must deal with any allegations expeditiously, seriously, confidentially, and fairly, whether or not there has been a written or formal complaint made to People Business partner. Informed managers are expected to: Managers who knowingly allow or tolerate any form of harassment or retaliation, including the failure to immediately report such misconduct to People Business Partner, are in violation of this policy and subject to disciplinary action, including termination. All employees have the responsibility to help create and maintain a work environment free of bullying and harassment and can help by: The Chief People Officer and People Business Partners are responsible for: All individual team members, managers, and leaders will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, for any act of harassment they commit. Although disciplinary action will be specific to each case, it can generally be classified into 4 levels: First time occurrences of inappropriate behavior. An act out of character. After formal investigation, coworkers still feel comfortable working with the offender. Recurring socially inappropriate behavior. Major infraction, including retaliation, or recurring socially inappropriate behavior after a written admonition. Serious cases, including any criminal offence. Training and guidance on understanding, preventing, and dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment will be provided to both managers and individual team members. The courses and the related enrollment logic can be found here . This training will be provided on a regular cadence, consistent with local requirements, and/or when new legal requirements are introduced. If attempts to resolve the problem in an informal manner prove insufficient or if these attempts were refused or proved to be ineffective, the victim may follow the procedure below: Without prejudice to the provisions that may arise from a judicial process instituted by the victim, one or more of the following sanctions shall be imposed on the person guilty of undesirable conduct: GitLab shall impose, by registered letter and within five working days, the sanctions imposed upon the person who has been guilty of undesirable behavior. In case an employee abuses this complaint procedure, the above sanctions may also apply for the employee. GitLab has engaged with an external health and safety service called Mensura who are responsible for handling any complaints of harassment that are received but can not be resolved informally and internally. Team members in Belgium may contact this service if they wish and make a request for an informal or formal psychosocial intervention. A request for a formal intervention should include the following: The psychosocial intervention advisor will investigate further and provide a report to the employee and People Business Partner with a recommended course of action. Protection from Power Harassment “Power harassment” is defined as any act by a person using his/her authority in the workplace, such as job position or human relationship with a team member, beyond the appropriate scope of business conduct, which causes such team member mental distress or physical pain or degradation of the working environment. The law defines power harassment as “remarks or behaviour by people taking advantage of their superior position that go beyond business necessity, thereby harming the workplace environment. GitLab expressly prohibits any behaviour toward team members that falls within the definition of power harassment. Depending on the individual, a person may feel dissatisfaction when given the instructions, advice, or guidance necessary in the ordinary course of business. In such cases where the actions are conducted within the scope of appropriate business practice, they should not fall under the category of power harassment. Examples of power harassment include, but may not be limited to: Team members who feel that they may have been subjected to power harassment may bring their complaints to their People Business Partner, who will engage the appropriate internal consultation services and respond to claims. GitLab is prohibited from dismissing or treating unfairly any team members who report harassment cases or cooperate in an investigation or consultation process. Prohibition of Sexual Harassment Team members are prohibited from any activities that cause disadvantage or discomfort to other employees or that are damaging to the work environment by way of speech or behaviour of a sexual nature. GitLab shall take all necessary measures in managing employment to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace. Prohibition of Harassment Due to Pregnancy, Childbirth, Child Care Leave, or Family Care Leave Team members are prohibited from any activities that are damaging to the work environment of other employees by way of speech or behaviour related to pregnancy, childbirth, etc., or use of systems or measures related to pregnancy, childbirth, child care, family care, etc. GitLab shall take necessary measures in managing employment to prevent harassment due to pregnancy, childbirth, child care leave, family care leave, etc. at the workplace. Prohibition of Any Other Forms of Harassment In addition to the prohibitions listed above, team members are prohibited from any other forms of harassment at the workplace that are damaging to the work environment of other team members such as by way of speech or behaviours related to sexual orientation or gender identification. The process and procedure for managing complaints of sexual harassment is set out in the GitLab India Private Limited Policy Against Sexual Harassment . Complaint Procedure and Contacts The Company is aware of and recognises the effect that bullying, harassment and sexual harassment can have on its team members. In addition to EthicsPoint and Lighthouse , please review the Team Member Relations handbook page. GitLab also offers a Harassment Complaint Form that any team member may use to document any instance of any type of workplace harassment. Simply copy the form, fill it out with your information and send it to our Team Member Relations Specialist at teammemberrelations@gitlab.com . Every team member located in the state of California will be required to read, review, and understand the following three documents during their onboarding: Every team member located in the state of Connecticut is required to take the 2 hour Anti Harassment Training for Supervisors. This training is to be completed by all individual contributors as well as managers. Team members who reside in Maine have the right to file a complaint through the Maine Human Rights Commission within 300 days of the date of the alleged discrimination. You may contact the Commission by phone at (207) 624-6290, TTY Maine Relay 711, or by visiting the office located at 51 State House Station, August Maine, 04333-0051.

Nondisclosure or Nondisparagement Agreements Under this policy, a nondisclosure agreement is any agreement by which one or more parties agree not to discuss or disclose information regarding any complaint of work-related harassment, discrimination, or sexual assault. A nondisparagement agreement is any agreement by which one or more parties agree not to discredit or make negative or disparaging written or oral statements about any other party or the company. A no-rehire provision is an agreement that prohibits a team member from seeking reemployment with the company and allows a company to not rehire that individual in the future. The company will not require a team member to enter into any agreement if the purpose or effect of the agreement prevents the employee from disclosing or discussing conduct constituting discrimination, harassment, or sexual assault. A team member claiming to be aggrieved by discrimination, harassment, or sexual assault may, however, voluntarily request to enter into a settlement, separation, or severance agreement which contains a nondisclosure, nondisparagement, or no-rehire provision and will have at least seven days to revoke any such agreement.

    "title": "Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging",
    "paragraph": "Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging is fundamental to the success of GitLab. We include it in every way possible and in all that we do. We strive for a transparent environment where all globally dispersed voices are heard and welcomed. We strive for an environment where people can show up as their full selves each day and can contribute to their best ability. And with over 100,000 organizations utilizing GitLab across the globe, we strive for a team that is representative of our users. Diversity complements our other values , specifically Collaboration, Efficiency and Results. And diversity in our leadership supports innovation , promotes better decision making and improves financial results . At GitLab, Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging (DIB) is fundamental to our success. We are building an environment where everyone can thrive and contribute through three strategic pillars: Pillar 1: Empowering our people Pillar 2: Uplifting our communities Vision : To create a global culture where everyone belongs, can contribute, and thrives—making GitLab the top organization for remote learning, development, and inclusive excellence. This updated structure reflects the comprehensive three-pillar approach shown in your attachment, moving away from the A.D.A.P.T. acronym to a more holistic framework that emphasizes empowerment, community engagement, and inclusive design. The phrase “Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging” (or DIB) refers to the terminology for the initiative to create a diverse workforce and an environment where everyone can be their full selves. Diversity refers to characteristics of the people who make up GitLab and how they identify. Race, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation are some examples of how the data might be categorized when looking at GitLab’s diversity. Sometimes we can see things that make us diverse and sometimes we can’t. We believe that a company composed of a diverse group of people may lead to diverse opinions and ideas which, if productively engaged with, can build innovation. GitLab uses the term “underrepresented” and it is meant to be a way of recognizing that we need more of what we do not have so that we can be at our best. The context is “at GitLab” or “in a specific department or team at GitLab.” This term is generally used in the context of reporting on how GitLab is working on understanding and improving the sourcing, interviewing, hiring, and retention of those who either want to work or currently work at GitLab. For additional information about how GitLab uses this data to make progress, please see “select underrepresented group” Inclusion is the ability to recognize, respect, and value differences in those around us. It focuses on the action and understanding of what makes us diverse and working towards building a diverse team and creating welcoming workplace. It requires skills such as empathy, openness, listening, etc. This lays the foundation of an inclusive mindset. The foundation of understanding gives way to the actions and being intentional about creating policies and practices that embrace diversity that in the end change the overall company culture to create an environment of inclusion. Inclusion also means being aware of both positive and negative biases and how those biases impact who we hire, work with, and retain. GitLab believes that many perspectives coming together creates a more innovative environment to work in with more satisfied team members, leading to a better product and increased profitability. Belonging is a feeling that your insights and contributions are valued. It goes back to team members feeling they can bring their full selves to work. It’s not enough to simply include people to have a “seat at the table”, but it’s important to amplify everyone’s voices, remove barriers and appreciate each others for their unique backgrounds. Embracing inclusion may increase the sense of belonging . Team members become more engaged and are invested in the work they are doing, because they are able to see themselves in the work being accomplished with the company overall. We believe in empowering team members to get their work done efficiently and collaboratively by establishing clear DRIs for all our work. DRIs do not owe anyone an explanation for their decisions , but DRIs can still acknowledge input by closing an issue and marking it Won't Do or commenting on an issue acknowledging that they have read all the comments. All team members don’t have to agree on the best course of action* we can disagree, commit, and disagree - but everyone can contribute and it is on the DRI to acknowledge those. Some other ways we actively cultivate a sense of Belonging at GitLab include creating and cultivating allies, welcoming family members in the background of a call, and sharing negative feedback in 1-1 settings . A good way to look at Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging is: An underrepresented group describes a subset of a population that holds a smaller percentage within a significant subgroup than the subset holds in the general population. The accepted definition of “underrepresented minorities” from the National Science Foundation and other major research institutions focuses on racial and ethnic groups whose representation in a profession is significantly below their representation in the general population. Populations whose representation in tech roles has been historically low. Tech roles are based on Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 skill designations. At GitLab, this includes all technical roles across the company, such as Engineering & Product. At GitLab, we consider the following groups to be underrepresented groups : **Due to data and or legal limitations, this is not an exhaustive list of all of our underrepresented groups. Those with disabilities, those that identify as LGBTQIA+, those who choose not to disclose as well as underrepresented ethnicities outside of the US, etc. The DIB Team is actively working on finding data sets outside the US and inclusion metrics for underrepresented groups we cannot report on as team member representation. Of Note: Management refers to Team Members who are People Managers, whereas Leadership denotes Team Members who are in Director-level positions and above. Source: GitLab’s People Analytics Team, WorkDay Inclusive teams are naturally more engaged, collaborative and innovative. We aim to align our values to be reflective of our company wide commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment. The GitLab team is fully distributed across the globe, providing our team the opportunity to connect with each others cultures, celebrations and unique traditions. We collaborate professionally and connect personally! Our unique all-remote team opens our door to everyone. Candidates are not limited by geography and we champion this approach , to the extent that it’s possible, for all companies! By having no offices and allowing each GitLab team member to work and live where they are most comfortable, GitLab offers a uniquely inclusive culture. Learn more about GitLab’s all-remote culture . Please see our identity data . This page provides an overview of our Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Talent Acquisition initiatives . This page provides an overview of our Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Engineering initiatives We list our Pregnancy & Maternity Care publicly so people don’t have to ask for them during interviews. In addition GitLab offers an Employee Assistance Program to all team members via Modern Health , a one-stop shop for all tools related to mental well-being and self-improvement. In our GitLab Values we list: ‘Use inclusive language. For example, prefer “Hi everybody” or “Hi people” to “Hi guys”. We have created several TMRGs and welcome interest in creating new ones. Would you like to sign up for an Team Member Resource Group, start an TMRG, or just learn more? See our TMRG Guide . GitLab welcomes military veterans from around the world, as well as military spouses, to learn more about life at GitLab and to apply for vacancies . We recognize the values gained from military experience, and we foster an inclusive atmosphere to thrive in when returning to civilian life. Our all-remote culture provides an ideal work environment for military veterans and spouses. By empowering team members to live and work where they are most comfortable, veterans and spouses can work in a safe, nurturing environment that they choose and design . We encourage military veterans and spouses to read testimonials from GitLab team members to understand the benefits of all-remote when joining the workforce following military service. We are committed to our Military Leave policy. GitLab is actively iterating within Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging and Talent Acquisition to ensure that additional underrepresented groups are pursued, embraced, and positioned for success. GitLab welcomes all types of team members, including any that may choose to identify as ones that currently have or were previously diagnosed as having a disability. In our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) Workday, on the Job tab page, in the Equal Employment Opportunity section, we have a field titled Disability Status that we ask our team members to complete during the onboarding process. The reason we ask is because it is a legal requirement in the United States under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 , as we are a Federal contractor and are required to ask employees to voluntarily self-identify if they have a disability or have ever had a disability, and to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. The options of this field are: If you are unsure how to answer, please review our Individual with Disabilities Policy . At GitLab, we are proud to make reasonable accommodations to the known disability of a team member. Please review the reasonable accommodation handbook section if you need a reasonable accommodation due to your disability. Find more information on GitLab Inc’s Individuals with Disabilities policy. The United States Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) enforces the affirmative action provisions of the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. This law, sometimes referred to as VEVRAA, requires employers doing business with the United States Federal Government (such as our GitLab Federal entity) to take steps to recruit, hire and promote protected veterans. It also makes it illegal to discriminate against protected veterans when making employment decisions on hiring, firing, pay, benefits, job assignments, promotions, layoffs, training, and other employment-related activities. Under VEVRAA, a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military and was discharged or release from service under conditions other than dishonorable may be classified as one or more of the four Protected Veteran categories: In our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) Workday, on the Job tab page, in the Equal Employment Opportunity section, we have a field titled Protected Veteran Status that we ask our US-based team members to complete during the onboarding process. The reason we ask is because it is a legal requirement in the United States for us to request this information. We encourage GitLab team members to self-disclose in our HRIS without any fear of judgment or negative consequences, but it is always optional. All veteran status data is completely confidential, and only requested for mandatory reporting purposes. Above this field, we have a section titled Veteran Status that we ask our US-based team members to review and also complete during the onboarding process, if it applies to them and if they so wish. The reason we ask is because it is a legal requirement in the United States for us to request and document this information. We encourage our US-based GitLab team members to self-disclose their Veteran Status in our HRIS without any fear of judgment or negative consequences, but it is always optional. Again, all veteran status data is completely confidential, and only requested for mandatory reporting purposes. If you are a team member on a GitLab Inc or Federal contract and a person with disability veteran you may request a “reasonable accommodation.” A reasonable accommodation is one that allows you to perform your job, and must be provided by GitLab unless doing so would cause GitLab significant difficulty or expense. A reasonable accommodation does not change essential job functions. GitLab can choose the type of reasonable accommodation that will be made available; however, the accommodation must be effective. More information on how to request a reasonable accommodation is available here . Please review the reasonable accommodation handbook section if you would like an accommodation due to your veteran status. Team members who might use this process include: DIB and L&D team members, managers creating training for their teams, departments creating required compliance training, team members creating training for their peers or community, Developer Relations creating training for the wider GitLab community GitLab team members are distributed across the globe, giving us access to an array of opportunity. We encourage collaboration with global organizations and programs that support underrepresented individuals in the tech industry. GitLab also provides additional support through the GitLab Diversity Sponsorship program . We offer funds to help support the event financially, and if the event is in a city we have a GitLab team member, we get hands-on by offering to coach and/or give a talk whenever possible. We encourage organizers of events that are supported through our GitLab Diversity Sponsorship program to share this sign up link with attendees. Everyone can contribute."

To be successful at GitLab, team members need to develop their daily priorities to achieve goals. Managers of one set the tone for their work, assign items and determine what needs to get done. No matter what role you serve, self-leadership is an essential skill needed to be successful as a manager of one. In some cases, a individual in the Management group , Director group , S-group , or even E-group may have an “Interim” or “Acting” title. In either case, they will be fulfilling the full responsibilities of the role. If you have any questions, about the future of the role, please ask them or their manager. Individual departments will have their own criteria for who is eligible to occupy these roles, so please check the career development page for your department. Please see the Making Decisions Leadership page. Most companies communicate from top to bottom through a chain of command. This communication flow often empowers managers, but it also introduces inefficiency as team members are not able to connect directly with the people they need to communicate with in order to get their work done. At GitLab, every team member is encouraged to reach out to whoever is the correct person (or people) to quickly unblock issues, solve problems or support in other ways. Do be courteous of your direct manager and copy them on the request. We don’t encourage unnecessary friction in asking team members to escalate through managers and wait for responses to come back. What matters is efficiency in getting to results. Slack the CEO, Slack a VP, or Slack a peer. Do what you need to do to make GitLab successful. Managers should not be bottlenecks or silos for communication. Anyone should feel comfortable reaching out to anyone else with the best information they can to solve a problem. This is a more efficient , transparent , and collaborative way to work. Giving regular feedback is extremely important for both managers and team members. Feedback can take the form of coaching sessions, separate from 1-to-1 meetings . Giving feedback is also about being prepared and, depending on the situation, you should create separate agendas and structure them as follows: Sometimes when performance dips, the best way to tackle it is to try to determine the root cause. This is easier said than done. There is a great tool that CEB (now Gartner) created to help with this called performance issue root cause diagnostic . It may not always be possible or appropriate to determine the root cause, so the underperformance process should be followed. As a leader, the way you respond to negative feedback makes a significant impact on your team. Remember that it can be difficult for people to approach someone in authority with concerns and respond with sensitivity and appreciation. In particular, we recommend that you keep the following in mind: A team member’s README page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with them, especially people who haven’t worked with them before. It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share your ideas of a good working relationship, to reduce the anxiety of people who may be on your team, now or in the future. READMEs provide a genuine report on how a person works, reducing bias/assumption and enabling people to work together based on a common framework. As part of GitLab’s transparency value, we encourage each GitLab team member to consider creating their own README. GitLab division README pages are linked below for context. Reading other READMEs is an important way to get ideas on what you can include in yours. Let these serve as a guide and inspiration to you. Alternatively you can create your README dogfooding GitLab’s README profile customization feature. Follow documentation on how to add details to your GitLab profile with a README. Do not forget to add your profile’s link to you division’s holding page. Once your README is created, consider adding a link to it from following places: This provides maximum visibility to others, so that they may read your README in advance of working with you. This allows them to take your working style and communication preferences into account, ideally increasing the overall level of empathy expressed. READMEs are particularly powerful when working with those outside of GitLab, who may be unfamiliar with our values . A README is a beacon of transparency , and helps set the tone for any working relationship. Coaching is about helping others help themselves. It is not about giving advice, instruction, or telling someone what to do. Coaching is about focusing on the future and identifying where the coachee wants to be and what they want to achieve. At GitLab, we’ve defined coaching as a conversation that helps people think for themselves, find their own answers, and commit to action they design. As a coach, your role is to clarify the pathway from the current state to the future. Coaches do this by enabling the coachee to make informed choices based on deeper insight. Please see no-matrix-organization We want to promote organic cross-functional collaboration by giving people stable counterparts for other functions they need to work with. For example, each Strategic Account Executive (SAE) works with one Sales Development Representative (SDR). With our categories every backend team of developers maps to a Product Manager (PM) and a frontend team . Giving people a stable counterpart allows for more social trust and familiarity, which speeds up decision making, prevents communication problems, and reduces the risk of conflicts. This way we can work effectively cross functionally without the downsides of a matrix organization . We want the best combination of a factory and a studio . The studio element means anyone can chime in about anything, from a user to the CEO. You can step outside your work area and contribute. The factory element means everyone has a clearly assigned task and authority. Team members should feel comfortable escalating issues when help is needed to resolve unexpected challenges. Effective escalations are good, because they speed up decision making. When team members escalate an issue, another person is brought in as a decision maker or adviser as other team members disagree or need help with alignment or a serious trade-off is needed. Escalation can offer clarity and a path forward, and can be a sign of seniority for the person initiating the escalation when they know what, how, and when to escalate. As noted in this medium article , explicit esclatation should answer these four questions: Folks who are escalating an issue should avoid surprising folks in the management chain. This means that other relevant team members should be aware that an escalation is occurring. For example, in E-Group, members agree that they will not go to the CEO with an escalation without first notifying other relevant members that this is happening. There may be some exceptions to first notifying managers or peers. For example, a team member feels unsafe in voicing a concern to a manager or their peers and feels that they can’t effectively escalate with standard notification without retribution. While exceptions may be appropriate, they should be rare. After a team member escalates an issue, it is OK if they disagree, commit, and advocate with the decisions made by the person they escalated to. Process has a bad reputation. It has that reputation for things that we try to avoid doing at GitLab. When you have processes that are not needed it turns into a bureaucracy. A good example are approval processes. We should keep approval processes to a minimum, by both giving people the authority to make decisions by themselves and by having a quick lightweight approval process where needed. But process also has good aspects. Having a documented process for how to communicate within the company greatly reduces time spend on on-boarding, increases speed, and prevents mistakes. A counterintuitive effect is that it also makes it easier to change processes. It is really hard to change a process that doesn’t have a name or location and lives in different versions in the heads of people. Changing a written process and distributing the diff is much easier. Managers have an tremendous responsibility around talent acquisition and retention of team members. GitLab leadership and management approach was built using principles covered in the book “ High Output Management .” Please see High Output Management to learn more. Building a team to deliver results is a very important aspect of improving efficiency and iteration . A high-performing team will always deliver results. As a leader at GitLab, your role is to develop a high-performing team to reach the desired level of performance and productivity. There are certain traits that high-performing teams display at GitLab: Watch the replay of our conversation with Jeb Hurley, Co-founder and Managing Partner Brainware Partners where we discussed: Skills and behavior of building high performing teams competency for Managers : The Drexler-Sibbet Team Performance Model is an excellent tool to help build high performing teams at GitLab. The model provides a roadmap for a team and a common language. It is a simplified description of how a team works together that highlights the most important things the team needs to focus on to reach high performance. At GitLab, we can use it as a frame of reference to developing high performing teams. It can help Managers ensure new and existing team members know the mission and direction of the team by the following: 7 Stages to developing high performing teams: Manager Resource: Identifying & Addressing Burnout Building and maintaining high performance includes staying mindful of team well-being and potential burnout. With GitLab’s results-driven culture, the demands of product innovation around AI, the fast-paced and ever-evolving business environment, our organization recognizes the crucial balance between achieving ambitious goals and maintaining the well-being of our team members. Everyone can access this handbook resource designed for managers to identify & address burnout . This has an ongoing impact on team performance. M-teams are management support groups made up of 3 to 6 managers who are in timezones that allow for sync meetings among members. M-teams should set up a regular meeting on a cadence agreed by the members with the agenda being “what’s challenging this week?”. Decide who will facilitate and each person will get a chance to have their challenge discussed in the meeting. When it’s your turn, you talk a little about what you’re struggling with. M-groups agree to a level of confidentiality so that group members are willing to be vulnerable; vulnerability leads to trust and better outcomes for the group. If you’re interested in starting or joining an m-team meeting, reach out to other managers in the #managers Slack channel. Books in this section can be expensed . Notable books from the E-Group Offsite Book Selections may be added to the list below. We sometimes self-organize book clubs to read through these books as a group. When you give leadership training please screen share the handbook instead of creating a presentation . Feel free to reach out to anyone in the People Group for further support on leadership development topics. You can find us on the team page , using the People Group dropdown. The team may also be reached via HelpLab. Learn more on GitLab’s view of being a public company . We have a page which documents our Mitigating Concerns . Many of our values help to mitigate some of these concerns."

    "title": "GitLab Onboarding",
    "paragraph": "Onboarding is incredibly important at GitLab. We don’t expect you to hit the ground running from day one. We highly recommend taking at least two full weeks for onboarding and only in week three starting with team specific onboarding and training. Please feel free to participate in your team’s work in your first two weeks, but don’t feel like you have to contribute heavily. All onboarding steps are in the onboarding issue template which is owned by the People Operations team. The onboarding process for the new team member is self-driven and self-learning , whilst also remaining as asynchronous as possible settling into the remote life at GitLab. At GitLab we take great pride in dogfooding our own product, that is why all onboarding tasks are completed in a GitLab issue. First of all, what is an issue? You can learn more about what an issue is here . The People Operations Specialist assigned to the team members specific onboarding will open the onboarding issue at least 4 days prior to the hire date. Each onboarding issue has a main section that contains tasks relevant to all GitLab team-members and a due date of 30 days. Below the main section are department and role-specific tasks. Some roles and departments have tasks that link to a supplemental issue template or an additional onboarding page. Reach out to your onboarding buddy or other GitLab team members if you need help understanding or completing any of your tasks. Through onboarding issues, you should gain access to our team member baseline entitlements . On Day 2 of onboarding an Access Request will be generated, if a template has been created for the role. Access requests are owned by the IT team. If you have any access requests related questions, please reach out to #it-help in Slack. In certain instances, the People Operations team may not be able to assist with onboardings due to a national holiday or Family and Friends Day. These specific dates are documented in the People Operations team availability . The People Operations team hosts a pre-onboarding call known as the Ta-New-Ki call (a play on the abstract Tanuki i.e. Japanese raccoon dog you will find in our logo). The purpose of this call, which is hosted in Zoom, is to give soon to onboard team members the chance to meet / socialise and to provide an opportunity to ask any lingering questions ahead of their start date. Internally we refer to this as an AMA (Ask Me Anything) call. Hiring managers and current team members (such as onboarding buddies), are more than welcome to join the call. This call occurs every two weeks on Thursday at three times to account for timezones. For current team members: To add the invite to your calendar, review the GitLab Team Meeting Calendar. For future team members: You will receive an email with the future dates. Please note that this call will take a place a week or two before your actual start date. By default, all new team members are added to the below Slack channels from day 1 to ensure that they are able to ask any questions or for assistance in the correct channels upfront: An issue is created for new team members at least 4 business days prior to their start date. The Manager and a People Operations Team member will be assigned to this issue. Managers and People Operations all have tasks that need to be completed prior to the start date to ensure a smooth and successful onboarding process. For questions or help with any of these tasks feel free to reach out in the issue or by creating a request via HelpLab. The Senior People Operations Specialist completes a monthly audit of all open onboarding issues to ensure that the new team member, manager and People Operations team tasks are completed. More importantly, there are certain tasks which need to be completed in line with our company compliance (security, payroll, etc). If any tasks are still outstanding, the People Operations Specialist will ping the relevant members on the issue requesting action on the items or checking whether the issue can be closed. It remains the responsibility of the People Operations Specialist to close the issue and remain compliant. The employment bot will automatically close any onboarding issues still open after 60 days. First of all, what is an issue? You can learn more about what an issue is here . To ensure a successful completion of the onboarding issue, it is important that all tasks are checked off, whether the task is applicable to the onboarding team member or not. Checking the box indicates one of the following: These templates are used by the People Operations team to onboard new team members. All onboarding related employment templates (country and role based) can be found in the public repository The People team is not involved in the process for hiring, onboarding, or offboarding temporary service providers. You can work with the Procurement team on these onboardings and review the temporary service provider internal handbook page for templates and other helpful information."

    "title": "GitLab Offboarding",
    "paragraph": "The offboarding process is facilitated by the People Operations team who collaborates throughout the process with various other stakeholders such as Team Member Relations, IT Operations and Payroll. If you have any questions around the offboarding process, please be sure to review the Offboarding FAQs handbook page. Note: Departing team members will receive a comprehensive email prior to their final date of employment with information such as the impact on benefits coverage, final pay, arranging for a laptop wipe and stock administration. For system access questions and laptop wipes related to offboarding, send an email to gitlab-laptop-recovery@gitlab.com . For payroll questions or outstanding expense claims, please reach out to either uspayroll@gitlab.com or nonuspayroll@gitlab.com . For any other offboarding questions from active team members please reach out to People Operations via HelpLab or send an email to people_operations@gitlab.com if your access has already been terminated. Note: If a termination date changes, please reach out to People Operations via HelpLab. The team will update Workday. The notice is used as supporting documentation of the change and is saved in the team members Workday record. In addition to submitting their resignation directly in Workday (following the guidelines in the ‘How to Submit a Resignation’ e-Learning or Job Aid ) and complying with any contractual requirements, Team Members resigning in France should also email a copy of their resignation letter to legal-employment@gitlab.com . In addition to submitting their resignation directly in Workday (following the guidelines in the ‘How to Submit a Resignation’ e-Learning or Job Aid ), Team Members resigning in Germany are required to provide a wet-ink signed resignation letter to the GmbH address and should liase with the People Operations team during offboarding to ensure it’s properly provided. Team Members located in Japan who are resigning need to complete this resignation form and send it to payroll via HelpLab by the 10th of the month in order to process this with the local provider/partner for correct taxations. Please download or make a copy of the document in order to complete. Team Members located in Singapore who are resigning and are not Singapore citizens need to complete a Letter of Undertaking document and send it to payroll via HelpLab in order to process this with the local provider/partner. Please download or make a copy of the document in order to complete. Team members the the PEO/EOR on UAE work visa’s who resign, completes their contract, or changes jobs, their visa must be cancelled by the company regardless of whether they leave the UAE. Team member’s with dependents must first either cancel dependent visas (if dependents are leaving the UAE) or place them on hold (if dependents are staying) - this is managed by the team member as the dependent visa sponsor. The PEO/EOR company handles the mandatory work visa cancellation process through MOHRE (for labor card) and GDRFA (for residence visa), which takes 1-3 working days. Team members have 30 days after cancellation to leave the UAE or obtain a new visa. Failure to cancel properly may result in re-entry bans, overstaying fines, and complications with final payroll and health insurance processing. Note: Involuntary terminations are only facilitated by Team Member Relations (TMR) who will initiate the process in Workday. Involuntary offboarding of any team member is never easy. We’ve created guidelines and information to make this process as humane as we can. Beyond the points outlined below, make sure to refer to our guidelines on underperformance , as well as the offboarding issue . The manager and the team member should have walked through the guidelines on underperformance before reaching this point. TMR: Terminate the team member in the system by following the steps documented in the following job aid (Workday Profile by selecting Actions followed by Job Change and finally Terminate Employee ). TMR: You will be prompted to indicate whether the termination is regrettable or non-regrettable and whether the team member would be eligible for re-hire in future or not i.e. with review unless specifically relating to conduct or job abandonment in which case they would not be eligible. TMR: Once you have submitted the termination details, you will be prompted to complete a Questionnaire confirming that the Manager or PBP have communicated termination to the business AND confirming that access has been shut off with IT. People Business Partner: You will receive the termination transaction to review, approve, and then enter a comment to confirm termination is ready for the offboarding process to begin. If PBP does not want the offboarding process to initiate they should NOT approve the termination until they’re ready. People Ops: will review all comment(s) and questionnaire to confirm the offboarding process is ready to begin. If needed, the Peopel Operations team member should reach out to the PBP to confirm the process can be initiated. This will complete the process of the involuntary termination. After the involuntary offboarding call has taken place and the last working day has been determined, team members will have no access to GitLab systems and may not be required to do any work on GitLab’s behalf. If they are on “Garden Leave” they will still be active on payroll through the termination date. When determining the timing of the involuntary offboarding call and termination date it is important to consider any effect this might have on ongoing tasks and responsibilities of the team member. No expenses may be incurred while on garden leave unless necessary to the performance of GitLab duties and approved by the team member’s manager or as subject to local law. As a manager, in collaboration with the Team Member Relations Specialist (TMR) and/or the People Business Partner (PBP), we recommend to avoid scheduling the involuntary offboarding call while a team member is scheduled for any sensitive customer meetings or is on-call . If this is unavoidable, the manager is responsible for ensuring a transition/remediation plan. People Engineering automations will generate the offboarding issue at the end of the team member’s last working day, as per notification from the Team Member Relations Specialist (TMR) and the People Business Partner (PBP). Once the Last Working Day or Garden leave expires the team member will be officially offboarded from GitLab. Prior to the offboarding issue and the overall process for the term listed below. If appropriate (to be determined by conversation with the manager, the Group Executive, and People Ops), use the following offboarding memo , which is provided here as an openly viewable Google Doc, but of course needs to be personalized and tailored to each individual’s situation. As written, it is applicable to US-based employees only. Separation and Release of Claims Agreements do not apply for all offboardings. To review in which cases they do/do not apply, please reference the Severance Eligibility document accessible by Team Member Relations team and PBPs. In the case that a severance agreement is applicable, the steps below should be followed: For team members who will be placed on leave during an investigation please follow the process below: The People Operations member in the relevant rotation will complete a weekly audit of all offboarding issues opened within that specific week and check that all People Operations tasks have been completed and that the label peopleops::done has been added. All offboarding tasks by all Departments need to be completed within 5 days of the offboarding date. For systems that are more critical and time sensitive, these will be completed within the first 24 hours (example 1Password, Slack) by the relevant Departments. Information about application & system deprovisioners can be found on the Tech Stack Applications handbook page . To ensure a successful completion of the offboarding issue, it is important that all tasks are checked off, whether the system/tool is applicable to the offboarding team member or not. Checking the box indicates one of the following: All voluntary exits are eligible to be added to the Slack channel #gitlab-alumni , unless otherwise noted. Involuntary exits are not eligible for the alumni channel, unless otherwise noted by Team Member Relations. The offboarding details provided by the termination transaction in Workday is how eligibility is determined and later shared with IT. The purpose of this channel is to network and socialize with team members. Joining the channel is voluntary and subject to GitLab’s Code of Conduct . GitLab, the company, monitors the channel and can remove people from it at their sole discretion. The GitLab Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is enforced in the channel. Our goals in communicating offboardings are transparency, and to provide an opportunity for team members to say goodbye. We understand that different individuals are comfortable with different levels of communication and that each offboarding situation has different situations and nuances. For this reason and out of respect for individuals, we have a couple of key guiding principles for communicating offboarding: Depending on the team members’ role, timing of communication may vary (e.g. direct team, key stakeholders, etc.), and managers have discretion to determine who should be informed most immediately. The typical order followed for communicating departures is: The “direct team” is typically the team member’s peers within their immediate team (I.E. reporting to the same manager and/or in the same functional group, etc.) and is typically a relatively small group of people. In most cases, team members communicate their departures to their direct team, though messaging should be cross-checked with their manager for consistency. Key stakeholder communication can be done through 1:1 notifications, and/or by posting the update in team-specific channels for general awareness. Key stakeholders are individuals that departing team members work very closely with (typically in their day-to-day work) that will feel the impact of the team member’s departure in their work. Managers of key stakeholders should also be looped into communication to ensure awareness. It is essential that key stakeholders are looped in to offboardings to: Departures should be communicated with stakeholders as soon as possible, with a maximum timeframe of 2 business days after the team member’s departure. Where possible and appropriate, we also encourage managers to work with departing team members to align on transitions plans to transition as much of the departing team members’ work as possible before their departure. In most cases, managers communicate team member departures to key stakeholders. As explained briefly in the offboarding issue , GitLab is not always able to provide full context on why people are leaving when they do. However as mentioned in the procedures, for voluntary offboarding , the team member can work with their manager on messaging to share a company-wide message about their departure. Once the news has been shared with the team member’s team and other stakeholders, and messaging is agreed upon between the departing team members and their manager, the departure message should be shared in the #team-member-updates Slack channel. Managers and team members can optionally leverage this template as a guide on how to communicate a team member’s upcoming departure: There will be situations in which team members prefer to share their offboarding message, and situations in which managers prefer to do so. Either is ok, so long as team member and manager have reviewed the messaging together prior to posting . If someone is let go involuntarily, this generally cannot be shared since it affects the individual’s privacy and job performance is intentionally kept between an individual and their manager . If you are not close to an employee’s offboarding, it may seem unnecessarily swift. Please remember that these decisions are never made without following the above process to come to a positive resolution first - we need to protect the interests of the individual as well as the company, and offboarding is a last resort. According to our values negative feedback is 1-1 between you and your manager and we are limited in what we can share about private employee issues. Please discuss any concerns you have about another employee’s offboarding with your manager or your People Business Partner. Given the expectations and responsibility that come with a VP and above position, when there is an involuntary offboarding for one of these positions, additional context for the personnel change can be provided to the organization. Managers should consider cross-posting the message in #team-member-updates to inform the wider Department of the departing team member. We strive to maintain personal information regarding all team members private, this includes information regarding a team members voluntary or involuntary departure from GitLab. However, a manager with the consent and approval of the departing team member can share more details with the GitLab team regarding the decision to leave GitLab. If the departing team member gives their manager permission to share that information then the manager will share while making the departure announcement on the team call. Regarding involuntary offboarding, certain information can also be shared with the GitLab team regarding the departure. The departing team member may work with their manager to author a goodbye message for voluntary offboarding: In some instances there will be no further clarification on why a team member has departed, if there are concerns you can address those with your manager. Different levels of transparency will exist based on maintaining respectful treatment for all departures. Having team members leave may be a learning opportunity for some, but should not be a point of gossip for anyone. Managers will need to balance the opportunity for learning with the expectation of privacy and consult their People Business Partner should they have questions. Transparency is one of our values. In the case of offboarding, we opt to share the feedback only with peers and direct reports as needed, since we balance transparency with our value of collaboration and constructive guidance shared 1-1. GitLab’s turnover data is only viewable internally. To track all tool deprovisioning, please open an offboarding issue following the offboarding standards . As part of offboarding, any GitLab property valued above 1,000 USD needs to be returned to GitLab. For laptops, please check and refer to the Laptop Buyback Policy which states that team members may , at GitLab’s discretion, have the option to keep or buy back their existing laptops either when it gets refreshed for a new one, or when the team member is offboarding. However, the option to purchase or keep a laptop at no cost may be voided where the team member is involved in cases of investigation, misconduct, termination for cause of any violation of GitLab’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics , or other legal or security related inquiries. To return your laptop to GitLab, please contact gitlab-laptop-recovery@gitlab.com immediately upon offboarding. This section of the Accounting Department. To remove someone from Navan Expense Log in to Navan Expense and go to “Settings” in the left sidebar. Select the right policy based upon the entity that employs the team member. Select “People” in the left menu. Select the individual’s name and click “Remove”. If the person has a Corporate Credit Card assigned to them, please notify Accounts Payable before un-assigning it. For involuntary offboardings it is optional to do a retrospective on the hiring, onboarding and coaching/communication of the departing team member. As a manager, you can use this template for a retrospective. Please share the filled out template with your manager as well as the People Business Partner for your group. Within the Engineering division this is a required process because it causes hiring managers to reflect on what led to the ultimate decision of parting ways with the team member, and how that might be prevented during future hiring processes. In the United States, Unemployment Insurance provides benefits to GitLab team members who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The purpose is to provide temporary financial assistance to employees who meet certain requirements. Unemployment insurance is administered at a state level and in compliance with Federal Law. Each state establishes its own eligibility criteria and regulations surrounding Unemployment Insurance with respect to the amount allocated, duration and eligibility for Unemployment Insurance. Eligibility criteria include meeting the state specified requirements in terms of both earnings and time worked during the base period. In some instances the state may require additional supporting information particularly more extensive wage related details surrounding a claim. Unemployment Insurance is funded through employer contributions and most states will have State Unemployment Taxes that apply however many employers typically pay the State Unemployment Taxes too. If you are a full-time team member and you are contacted by your state’s Unemployment Commission to discuss your request for Unemployment Benefits, you may be a victim of Unemployment Claim Fraud. Before giving out any information to the caller, please confirm that you are speaking with an agency employee. If you confirm with your state’s Unemployment Commission that there is a fraudulent claim, please report it via HelpLab to the People Operations team. Additionally here is a link to the U.S Department of Labor Contact Particulars to report Unemployment Insurance Fraud."

    "title": "Talent Assessment",
    "paragraph": "The purpose of the Talent Assessment Program is to identify and retain team members who drive the success of our organization. This is a top priority and strategic process for people managers at GitLab. Our Talent Assessment Program (which is a critical piece of our overall Talent Development Program serves as a mechanism to help mitigate a couple of our biggest concerns: lack of performance management and losing key people . Additional key benefits of the Assessment Program include: We use Workday to complete our Talent Assessment. You can review an overview of Workday Talent here . Please reach out to your People Business Partner if you have any questions. You can also review the following guide which mirrors what is included in the Workday Talent Assessment template to prepare you prior to the tool being launched. There are many talent assessment options, and we have opted to use a Performance/Growth Potential Matrix (commonly known as “9-Box” in the US) and annually review Key Talent. GitLab’s Performance/Growth Potential Matrix is a type of talent assessment that forms part of our Talent Development Program . The FY25 talent assessment should consider performance from the period FY25Q1 - FY25Q4 In addition to assessing Performance/Growth Potential, we annually review Key Talent aligned with the criteria outlined below on this page. The combination of Performance/Growth Potential and Key Talent assessments allow us to identify team members who drive the organization’s success and use our engagement tools to retain them. For team members with a tenure up to three months to the launch of the Talent Assessment Program will be designated as “Too New to Rate”. Also in some cases a “Too New to Rate” designation might be applicable for newly promoted or transferred team members. More about that designation can be found below. This matrix is an individual assessment tool that evaluates both a team members current contribution to the organization and their potential level of contribution. It is commonly used in succession planning as a method of evaluation an organization’s talent pool, identifying potential leaders, and identifying any gaps or risks. It is regularly considered a catalyst for robust dialogue (through a calibration process) and is considered more accurate than one person’s opinion. The performance/growth potential matrix can be a diagnostic tool for career development. The matrix serves as a tool to help managers assess, develop, and coach their team members - ultimately resulting in an ability to more effectively and efficiently lead teams. Performance includes both results and behaviors, and is broken into three areas: Developing, Performing, and Exceeding. Please note that Developing should not be automatically associated with underperformance. As highlighted below, Developing can also be used for new hires or newly promoted team members that are still ramping up in their new roles. Your manager will provide example and detail to ensure the rationale behind the Developing rating is communicated. Based on the Job Family responsibilities, values and remote working competencies , team members in this category are not meeting all of the expectations. There is still more to learn and improve on in the current position to achieve the desired results. This may be due to the following: Based on Job Family responsibilities, values and remote working competencies team members in this category are “on track” and meeting all expectations. They can independently and competently perform all aspects of the Job Family responsibilities in a way that is aligned with our values and competencies. Their performance consistently meets the requirements, standards, or objectives of the job, and they can occasionally exceed expectations. They deliver results in a timely and accurate fashion. This performance may be expected as a result of: Team members that are exceeding consistently surpass the demands of their current position. They demonstrate unique understanding of work beyond the assigned area of responsibility. They contribute to GitLab’s success by adding significant value well beyond Job Family requirements, values , and remote working competencies . This performance may be expected as a result of: Please note that an Exceeding assessment for the performance factor does not guarantee a promotion. While the performance factor is a consideration, there are several considerations that are reviewed when evaluating promotion readiness. Please work with your manager to align expectations. Note that this is an expected distribution, not a forced distribution. The bell curve distribution aligns with what is most commonly used as a benchmark in the industry and serves as a baseline for us to review and calibrate against. There may be exceptions that are justified that can be discussed and reviewed during calibration. Where deviations from the expected distribution occur, managers should use this as a data point to further review and work with their leadership to ensure appropriate growth plans are in place, proper role fit exists, hiring plans are adjusted, that we are promoting at a fair and accurate rate. We expect roughly ~5% of team members to be assessed as TNTR (Too New To Rate) . Performance: Remember that “Developing” for Performance and Growth Potential should not be automatically associated with underperformance, and that many newly promoted team members and new hires fall into this category. While the primary objective of the performance axis of the Performance/Growth Potential Matrix is to calibrate team member performance, this axis of the matrix also directly impacts the Performance Factor , which is a determining factor in the annual compensation review. Please reference the Total Rewards Performance Factor page for more detail on compensation impact. How can managers determine whether their team members are Developing, Performing, or Exceeding? “The Performance Factor” is determined from several components outlined below. It is optional to use The Performance Factor Worksheet for weighing the different Performance Factors. Performance against Job Family responsibilities, requirements, performance indicators, and functional competencies (if applicable) should be weighted at 60%. For management roles, please also review and consider the levels outlined in the Organizational Structure. Performance against these competencies should be weighted at 40%. When completing the talent assessment form, team members and managers should reflect on the applicable competencies and job frameworks when filling out the achievements, strengths, and opportunities section. Given GitLab’s CREDIT values should be lived, with each day representing a new opportunity to refamiliarize oneself with said values and strive to implement them in every professional interaction, there is an opportunity for team members and managers to rate how a team member demonstrates each of the CREDIT values. The following rating scale is used for each value: Use the comment box at the end of the CREDIT values section to provide examples to support the ratings selected. While performance is focused on the past and present, growth potential is focused on the future. Because of the nature of the future-focus associated with growth potential, it is more difficult to measure than performance, and inherently more qualitative than quantitative. A key element in determining growth potential is the manager and leadership observation and experience working with team members. Managers can gauge team member growth potential against the expectations in their current role or their growth potential to take on different roles across GitLab. Growth potential refers to the ability and desire of a team member to successfully assume increasingly more broad or complex responsibilities and learn new skills, as compared to peers and the roles’ responsibilities outlined in their respective Job Family. This could include the growth potential to move up to the next level in their job family, and/or a lateral move. The Growth Potential assessment helps managers determine the best growth trajectory for their team members. The growth potential assessment will be used as input to leverage our engagement tools, offer lateral and upwards career opportunities, and do succession planning. Growth Potential can change over time as team members develop new interests, as new opportunities for growth arise, and as team members continue to broaden their knowledge, skills, and abilities. There are four primary pillars to consider when measuring growth potential: Under each pillar there are a few questions that managers should consider when assessing team member growth potential. Please note that the answer to all of these questions does not have to be yes to determine a team member is “exceeding” growth potential, the questions are here to help guide managers through the thought and evaluation process. After assessing team member growth potential based on the four pillars outlined above, managers can determine whether team member growth potential is currently developing, growing, or exceeding. “Developing” growth potential generally refers to a team member who is not working at full growth potential against the roles and responsibilities outlined in their Job Family. There could be a variety of reasons for this, including: Please note that “developing” growth potential does not equate to “developing” performance, but correlates with the pillars of growth potential outlined in the “measuring growth potential” section below. “Growing” growth potential generally refers to a team member who is growing in their current role and demonstrating interest in advancing (up or laterally) and they exhibit knowledge, skills, and abilities that indicate this. Team members with “growing” growth potential generally: “Exceeding” growth potential generally indicates that a team member will be ready for promotion within the next year (or when an opportunity arises). “Exceeding” growth potential team members: The portion of the Performance/Growth Potential matrix that often entails the most significant time commitment is the live calibration session of team members with leadership. The calibration session is very valuable to ensure consistency across the Job Family and level, raise any questions, and provide cross-departmental and/or cross-divisional feedback on team members to capture the assessment of different managers as opposed to the opinion of the direct manager exclusively. Calibration can be done asynchronously or synchronously, and should be done by level (i.e. Manager calibration for their directs, Director calibration for their directs, etc.) so as not to disclose Talent Assessment evaluations amongst peers. For newly onboarded team members, with a tenure up to 3 months, we have implemented a “Too New to Rate” (TNTR) assessment category. This designation will be applied to individuals with a start date within 3 months of the kick off of Talent Assessment as they have not yet had sufficient time to demonstrate their Performance/Growth Potential according to the defined pillars. The introduction of a “Too New to Rate” category is a solution as feedback was raised that being rated “Developing” in many cases does not reflect the actual Performance/Growth Potential. Therefore a TNTR designation is to accurately reflect the time to get up and running of recently onboarded team members. This category acknowledges that new hires require a reasonable timeframe to familiarize themselves with the organization, their role, and the expectations before they can be accurately assessed using the Performance/Growth Potential Matrix. While newly onboarded team members do not need to complete the Talent Assessment evaluation in Workday, it’s still important for them to have a check-in conversation with their manager. We recommend that this conversation happens after the team member has completed 3 months with GitLab. We’ve created this template for team members and managers to complete. The goal would be for the newly onboarded team member and their manager to come together to have a conversation reflecting on their first 3 months at GitLab, highlighting their strengths and opportunities, then aligning on any support needed for the team member moving forward. Besides team members with a GitLab tenure up to 3 months (New hire TNTR), the “Too New to Rate” designation will also be available for team members that have just transferred or were promoted to a new role. Please see the Promotions or Transfer During Assessment Cycle section for more details and guidance on how to evaluate and consider performance in these scenarios. If any of the above cases arise it is recommended that you discuss with your People Business Partner to ensure the Too New to Rate designation is consistently applied. The calibration session is one of the most important pieces of the Performance/Growth Potential Matrix process, as it provides time for managers, their peers, and their manager to calibrate. Below are a few communication guidelines to ensure efficiency and fairness during the calibration session discussion. It is likely not necessary to discuss each team member in detail, particularly for larger groups. Calibration sessions typically focus on gaps, outliers and areas that might require additional management attention and/or alignment. As a best practice, we should calibrate outliers. “Outliers” are typically considered to Box 1 (“Exceeding Growth Potential” and “Exceeding Performance”) and Box 9 (“Developing Growth Potential” and “Developing Performance”) . People Business Partners and business leaders have discretion to expand this threshold as needed, but live calibration for team members in Box 1 and Box 9 should be the baseline across the board. A few additional reasons to consider calibrating beyond Box 1 and Box 9 are: It is absolutely essential that managers complete the required pre-work to ensure that the live calibration session is as efficient and productive as possible. Pre-work includes: While we want to encourage open and transparent conversation during calibration session, there are certain topics that should be avoided to ensure we respect team member privacy. After the calibration sessions the performance and growth potential outcomes can be used as input for the following: Detailed dates for FY26 are pending and process is subject to modification. In general the timeframe runs from January through March with ACR (compensation statement) release in April and compensation changes and promos effective beginning of May. Note that different departments may have additional due dates built into the high level timeline, so please follow up with your People Business Partner if you have any questions. Below are the current activities for the formal assessment beginning in Q4 (January) *Team members who are on Leave of Absence (LOA) on TBD are excluded from the auto advancement of their talent assessment until they return to work. Note: For full details on our Annual Compensation Review (ACR) timeline and cycle, please refer to our ACR handbook page . GitLab completes talent assessment at least once per year in Q4, with a recommended informal mid-year check-in. The formal assessment ideally takes place prior to the annual compensation review . Our e-group completes Performance/Growth Potential Matrix multiple times a year for their direct reports. Anyone hired on or before January 31st should receive a Performance and Growth Potential assessment, as they are eligible for Annual Compensation Review. However, if the team member being assessed has been with GitLab for a period of 3 months or less or recently transferred roles or was promoted, please see the Too New To Rate description . It is up to all team members’ discretion if they wish to complete their Self-Evaluation in Workday. While they are voluntary, self evaluations are highly encouraged so the team member’s perspective is captured and shared with their manager prior to the manager’s evaluation and Calibration Sessions. Please review the most current timeline to ensure a timely delivery. Team members may use Claude, Insights, and GitLab Wrapped to assist in the preparation of your self evaluation. AI tools like these can be super helpful to assist you in gathering information about your accomplishments, or helping you brainstorm how you might refine your self evaluation. However, meaningful human input and review is always required, and you should not rely solely on Claude to write your self-evaluation. The Performance/Growth Potential Matrix typically takes 4-6 weeks to complete from beginning to end. Steps are as follows: Aligned with the timeline , managers can see final assessments for each of their team members in their respective Workday profiles. The cut-off date to determine whether to assess team members as Too New to Rate based on recent promotion/transfer for the FY25 Talent Assessment cycle is based on their time in role prior to the start of the Talent Assessment cycle, 2025-01-27 . Please note, that a “transfer” constitutes as a change to one or multiple of the following things: job family, department, division, or job grade. A change in job title specialty and manager alone would not constitute as a transfer. It is important to note that because being promoted recognizes high performance both in terms of increased scope/responsibility and monetarily through compensation increase therefore a promotion “resets” the performance factor evaluation . While a recent promotion resets the performance factor evaluation, and a job transfer is internal mobility that may be a lateral job level, there are soft skills and technical skills that are most likely transferable. When assessing team members who have transferred teams or changed roles throughout the year, managers should gather feedback from the previous manager on performance as well and take that into account when evaluating and documenting performance to reflect performance for the entire year. Managers should also provide the team member feedback on how they’re doing in their current role to ensure they’re set up for success, and aware of feedback moving forward in their current position. In most companies the Performance/Growth Potential Matrix is used exclusively as a management tool and results are not typically shared with team members. In the spirit of our transparency value, we want to encourage feedback with team members. Discussion topics that arise during calibration sessions (or at any other point during the assessment process) are confidential. Please do not share with anyone other than each individual team member. After calibration sessions are done and performance and growth potential factors are determined, it’s time to communicate the final results with team members. Please follow the Talent Assessment timeline and communicate performance and growth potential ratings to team members in your performance review conversations within the communication window . The conversation following the talent assessment process is the most important part; it is a great way to drive alignment with your team members and set them up for success moving forward. Below are some of the best practices for communications, but remember, if you are ever in doubt please reach out to your manager or People Business Partner for additional support. The script below is intended to help you structure your Performance and Growth Potential conversation. Personalizing this conversation to reflect your authentic tone will make this a more effective conversation with your team member. “Thank you for taking some time today to discuss your Performance and Growth Potential. I wanted to discuss your achievements and strengths, improvement areas, future development, and the final result of the talent assessment.” “I assessed your performance factor as * [Insert Performance factor] :” “I assessed your performance as [Insert Performance Factor] because:” “I assessed your growth potential factor as * [Insert Growth potential factor] :” “I assessed your growth potential as [Insert Growth Potential Factor] because:” If a team member was identified as key talent , please ensure to communicate to the team member during the talent assessment conversation. I’d like to thank you for your hard work as, and I look forward to continuing to work together! Do you have any questions? [Allow team member to ask questions and respond] As a next step, let’s schedule some time to talk more about what you want to do in the future and create a career development plan together OR let’s talk about how this feedback should be incorporated into your Individual Growth Plan. The most important part of the talent assessment discussion is to determine next steps in partnership with your team member. The team member should be the DRI for the next steps with support from you as their manager. Our Career Development handbook page includes a lot of great information and resources on career development including an Individual Growth Plan guide which should help provide structure and a plan for next steps. If you have any questions or concerns about next steps, please contact your manager and/or your People Business Partner . The Talent Assessment involves all team members and managers. Team Members are assessed according to performance and growth potential . Team Members should be prepared to have a conversation with their manager about their performance and growth potential in Q1 each year. Managers assess their team members’ performance and growth potential . Managers attend calibration meetings in which team members’ ratings are discussed and evaluated to ensure consistency and minimize bias. Once the program closes, managers are responsible for communicating Performance/Growth Potential Factor to team members. Can I use Claude or other AI tools to help me with my self evaluation? Yes. You may use Claude, Insights, and GitLab Wrapped to assist in the preparation of your self evaluation. AI tools like these can be super helpful to assist you in gathering information about your accomplishments, or helping you brainstorm how you might refine your self evaluation. However, meaningful human input and review is always required, and you should not rely solely on Claude to write your self-evaluation. Can I utilize Claude or other AI tools to help with manager evaluations? Claude is the only AI tool you are permitted to use for this purpose, and it may only be used to assist in the writing of manager evaluations. Use of Insights, GitLab Wrapped, or any other AI tool for the assessment of team members or the writing of manager evaluations is not permitted. Claude can be super helpful to assist you in brainstorming how you might refine the feedback in your manager evaluation. However, meaningful human input is required in assessing performance and growth potential of your team members, and you should not rely solely on Claude to write manager evaluations. We also have a robust calibration process in our talent assessment program to ensure we are consistently and fairly assessing performance and growth potential across GitLab. How does this impact the way I work at GitLab? How does this impact the teams I lead? Who can I reach out to in supporting me during Talent Assessments for my team? As a manager, when reviewing my team members, what is the difference between Developing and Underperformance? Will my Growth Potential assessment impact my compensation? Can my performance factor be changed? Does this mean I am automatically getting an X% increase in the upcoming Annual Compensation Review? The Performance/Growth Potential Factor is one of the factors considered in the Annual Compensation review . The recommended increases displayed in the handbook are there to ensure company wide consistency. The factors taken into account for the Annual Compensation Review are: When is the next opportunity for my performance to be reviewed? What can I do to change my performance factor in the future? Can my Growth Potential rating be changed? What can I do to change my Growth Potential rating in the future? My team member is currently on a performance remediation plan; how should I handle this? My team member is on a leave (protected leave or PTO) during the Talent Assessment period. How should I handle communication of their assessment? If they will be returning from leave before the due date to communicate Talent Assessment results , please wait until their return from leave to communicate their assessment. If they are returning from leave after the due date to communicate Talent Assessment results, you may email them to offer to discuss their assessment. If they do not reply or prefer to wait until their return, please respect that choice. My team member was on protected leave for a large portion of the Talent Assessment period. How should I factor this in when assessing them? It’s important to ensure you are assessing the team member’s performance for their contributions while working during the assessment time period. There should be no adverse impact on their overall assessment due to being on leave for a portion of the period. During calibration, please remain vigilant to ensure no private details related to their time away are disclosed. Please reach out to your PBP to discuss the specific details related to your team member. My team member is on leave of absence during the Talent Assessment communication window. What happens to their Talent Assessment? Please do not action the To-Do task “Meet with your Employee” if your team member is on leave of absence (LOA). We will exclude team members on LOA from the auto advancement setting on TBD and you can communicate their talent assessment when they return to work. My team member was assessed as key talent last year, and is not for this assessment period. How should I handle communication with them? There is no guarantee that team members will retain their key talent assessment each assessment period. Make sure to explain the reasons why their key talent assessment has changed, including how we assess Key Talent and the definition outlined in the Handbook . Remember to end the conversation by discussing what your expectations are of key talent going forward. It’s important not to make promises about future assessments, but to focus on what makes a team member critical to the business, and how you, their manager, will support them. My team member was exceeding performance last assessment, and is not for this period. How should I communicate this change? It’s important to take a look at what may have changed since last year. Is your team member in a new role? On a new team? Did they take on bigger stretch assignments? Any of these factors can influence a team member’s performance. Be prepared with specific examples to share which support your performance assessment. The feedback conversation should also focus on what success looks like for the team member in the year to come and how you, as the manager, can support them with their goals. I have just adopted a new team, and the previous manager is no longer at GitLab. How can I assess the performance of my team fairly? You may be able to gather insights from your manager or cross functional stakeholders who have worked closely with the team member in the performance period. You may have access to the recent 360 feedback for each of your team members, as well as their talent assessment from last year to help inform your thinking. If you haven’t already, it’s important to ask the team member to share their own perspective on their accomplishments prior to you taking the role, so you are well prepared for the discussion of your assessment. A team member recently moved to be my direct report, however for the majority of the performance year, they reported to another manager. Are there options to delegate or re-assign the manager evaluation to their previous manager? As a manager, you can delegate the manager evaluation to another manager in your direct management chain. If your team member moved from another manager in another organization, you should collaborate with the previous manager to write the review with their input. The previous manager can leverage the Talent Assessment google template to capture their feedback and provide it back to you so that you can enter it into Workday. As the new manager, you will be responsible for the calibration of team members in your management chain at the time of calibration. You should also ensure your communication of the final talent assessment is done in a joint conversation with the previous manager, you as the new manager and your team member. This would be a great opportunity to ensure a formal transition and knowledge of performance and feedback takes place between previous manager and new manager. Please enter a HelpLab request if you have any questions about your specific scenario. My team member does not agree with their placement in performance and growth potential. How should I approach this? Remember that this conversation will be most effective if you are well prepared. If you haven’t yet, take an opportunity before the performance and growth potential conversation to understand their own assessment of their results. During the performance and growth potential conversation, provide the opportunity for a dialogue with your team member. Remain open and curious about their perspective. Engage in active listening, ensuring that you aren’t planning your counterpoints while they are sharing. The expectation is not that the results will necessarily change but the insights they provide may shape how you both think about their growth and development path. If you feel a conversation might be particularly challenging, you may reach out to the TMR team or your PBP to role play the discussion and ensure you are prepared. My team member is exceeding growth potential expectations, how should I be thinking about their ongoing development? Great! At GitLab team members have the opportunity to own their own development, and deserve a great manager (you) to facilitate it. Ask your team member to articulate where they would like to see their skills and career develop. You may have insights that help them refine those goals based on where you see the business going, as they will be most successful in gaining the experience they’re looking for if there are opportunities to align those goals with business goals. The Career Development handbook page has more ideas to help your team member craft a growth plan, including information on GitLab’s Growth and Development benefit . How should we be communicating Growth Potential to team members? First, ensure the team member understands what we mean when we say we are assessing Growth Potential, including the 4 pillars that you considered when making the assessment. Be prepared with specifics that led to your evaluation. Remember, Growth Potential can change over time as team members are promoted, develop new interests, as new opportunities for growth arise, and as team members continue to broaden their knowledge, skills, and abilities. Avoid making promises, but if your team member sees themselves in a higher position, help them understand behaviors you expect to be able to assess them differently next time. I received unexpected feedback about my team member from a cross-functional stakeholder in my calibration session. What should I do? If you receive unexpected feedback during the calibration, ensure you really understand what happened, and what has been discussed with your team member so far. If someone has tried to help this team member in the past, how did it go? Can your peer provide specifics to help you understand the impact of the behaviors? Talk to your peer about the importance of using this feedback to help your team member grow, and make sure you have agreement on how you plan to deliver this message. During the discussion with your team member, be prepared to gain their perspective on the situation first. Listen actively and consider their point of view. When delivering the message, consider the root cause, focus on impact and alignment with our values, and end with a discussion on future actions that would be more successful. If and when appropriate, check in with your peer on how improvements are going. Be sure to stay close to the situation so you are in a position to deliver more timely feedback if the behavior is ongoing. How do I assess team members in acting or interim roles? For team members who have assumed an Acting or an Interim role , we will assess team members aligned with their permanent positions (i.e. not the Acting or Interim position). As the Talent Assessment impacts compensation, and Acting/Interim periods are not permanent, in the instance that a team member does not end up moving into the Acting/Interim role permanently, we would not want to have their compensation impacted by a temporary position. My team member is performing at a high level in terms of results, but they struggle with behavioral alignment to one or more of our values. How do I take the “how” into account when I am assessing their performance and growth? Review the handbook content on how we measure Performance and how we measure Growth Potential . When a high output/results-oriented team member is struggling with soft skills and/or behavior, this is oftentimes related to improvement areas in terms of alignment to our values competencies , and/or our Growth Potential pillars (particularly, but not limited to, Self-Awareness). Considering our measurement guidelines for Performance and Growth Potential holistically, and be sure that your assessment takes all of our competencies, job family responsibilities, and pillars into account. My team member has the skills to perform, but there are will-based performance issues that are impacting their ability or the team’s ability to succeed. How should I think about this in terms of assessing their performance? First, act early. Do not wait for a formal performance and growth potential assessment conversation to deliver feedback about your concerns. Be specific, and document your conversation. Loop in a TMR specialist for support as these conversations can be challenging. Review the definition of “Developing” performance. Note that one criteria that applies to this category is a team member who is struggling to perform in a way that is aligned to our values and competencies. Think about the specific behaviors or impacts of their work or how they are working that have led you to assess that they are not fully engaged. Despite having the skills, if your team member is not contributing at the level they are expected to be, you should consider that a performance issue in the way you would a skill based performance issue. Keep in mind that not addressing these challenges may be affecting your other team members, especially those who may be picking up the slack. We encourage to review the handbook page on Underperformance . Great managers share feedback with team members year-round in 1:1 meetings and ad-hoc. A dedicated Mid-Year check-in is a useful tool to support a holistic discussion between team member and manager about how things are going as we approach the second half of the fiscal year. During the Mid-Year check in, we assess how things are going from both the team member and managers’ points of view, and share feedback to help inform performance and development plans. Leaning into where things are going well, as well as uncovering blind spots or improvement areas early are the keys to delivering great results. A Mid-Year check in complements weekly, on-going feedback, so we recommend documenting your discussion in your 1:1 doc to support frequent updates on action items and development goals. Goals of the Mid-Year check in are: To participate in the mid-year check in we recommend that team members have at least 3 months of tenure so accomplishments and improvement areas are able to be clearly outlined with examples. Recommended process for our Mid Year check-in will be as follows: Team Member Led: Team member provides a self-assessment on their own performance in their 1:1 document A Google docs template is available to guide the self-assessment process. Team members are encouraged to author a document based on this template, share it with their manager and link it to the top of their 1:1 document. Team members should reflect on their achievements, strengths, and opportunity areas since the last formal Talent Assessment in Q4. It is the team member’s responsibility to provide the self-assessment and bring it to the conversation with their manager to discuss and align on. Linking the document to the 1:1 agenda ensures the self-assessment is available to come back to throughout the rest of the year. The template contains an agenda for the Mid-Year check-in as follows: List your 3 most significant achievements since the last formal Talent Assessment , aligned with the job responsibilities and expectations of the role. This can include significant impact to the department or company, customer-impact, community-impacting, etc. Feedback can also be included in this section if applicable. Strengths & Opportunities in Role In this area the goal is to determine 2-3 strengths and 2-3 opportunity areas in accordance with your role, job family, and job framework . Include examples when necessary to provide clarity or context. Ensure there are actionable takeaways. A place to outline any support needed from your manager for your ongoing success and development at GitLab. Managers will provide additional feedback or response to the self-assessment outlined above. Managers should be sure to reference the Achievements (3) and Roles & Responsibilities (Strengths and Opportunities) outlined by the team member above, and to any additional thoughts or feedback (2-3 points). A space for the team member and manager to document any relevant next steps stemming from this conversation. This could be a full Individual Growth Plan or a couple of key actions or development opportunities for the individual. Manager Feedback: Team members let their manager know when they have provided their self-assessment overview in their 1:1 document Team members should share their Mid-Year Check In document with their manager at least one week prior to the live discussion to ensure managers have time to review the content, and to add in their own feedback in the Manager Feedback section. Team members and managers use a dedicated 1:1 to discuss the Mid Year check in. Team member and manager align on action items stemming from the conversation to best support team member development and alignment to their goals. You are encourage to leverage our Career Development and Mobility ) handbook page for ideas and inspiration. Mid-Year Check-In Timeline (FY2026): Succession planning is an important step in our Talent Assessment process. Completing the Performance/Growth Potential Assessment gives leaders a fresh overview of the top performers and the highest growth team members in their respective organizations. Particularly for individuals in Senior Leadership roles and above (the S-Group and depending on structure the Director-Group , a recommended next step following the Performance/Growth Potential assessment is to do succession planning. Succession planning ensures we are identifying and developing future GitLab leaders to ensure business continuity in the event of an unforeseen change, and providing the current leadership team the opportunity to grow and scale. It may provide an opportunity to diversify our leadership team by developing our internal bench of talent. Note, potential alone does not determine who will be a successor. Strong succession candidates should demonstrate sustained exceeding performance and growth, aspire to have a role at the next level, and be ready for a much larger role in the near term. Questions we should ask ourselves when thinking about succession planning (and the individual(s) identified) are: The succession planning process might vary slightly for different areas of the business depending on size and structure, but at a high level the process should flow as follows: Note that the Emergency Coverage slide in the template above should only be used to if the identified successor could not provide temporary coverage for the current leader in an emergency situation. Key Talent makes up roughly ~10% of the population. Key Talent represents team members who have a significant impact on GitLab’s present and future success. They deliver quality results that are instrumental in moving critical company initiatives forward and do so consistently in alignment with our values. These team members are often recognized as experts in their current role. Team members, at any level, can be considered Key Talent. Team members identified as Key Talent typically have knowledge, skills, and experience that: Team members identified as key talent must be assessed at minimum Performing and Growing (Box 4) in the Talent Assessment process . Although Performance and Growth Potential are a consideration in the Key Talent selection process, they are not the only criteria used to determine the designation and should not be used in isolation. It is important to look holistically at the Key Talent Criteria outlined above when determining who qualifies as Key Talent on your team. “TNTR” (Too New to Rate) team members can be considered key talent but this would be an exception. In order for a “TNTR” team member to be identified as key talent they must meet the criteria above and be ramping successfully in their new role. We exclude team members rated “TNTR” when we calculate our Key Talent distribution across the company. E.g. Team members designated Key Talent during Calibration divided by Talent Assessment eligible team members (excluding TNTR) = Key Talent Distribution % Below are a few examples to help managers think through Key Talent designations as they relate to Performance and Growth Potential: Note: Intentionally hoarding knowledge is in direct conflict with our transparency value and is viewed as a performance issue as we measure performance based on alignment with our values. Single Points of Failure (SPOF) refers to a single person whose absence would significantly impact the ability of an area of the company to function. Team members that are identified as Key Talent can also be SPOF, as the definition of SPOF overlaps with a few of the Key Talent Criteria outlined above, however, a team member who is identified as SPOF is not also Key Talent by default. A few key differences between Key Talent and SPOF include: team member’s performance and growth potential, risk mitigation plans, and support/development strategies. Four scenarios exist in the context of our Talent Assessment: To review the SPOF definition in more detail along with a few examples, please review our Organizational Design handbook page. It is important to have a holistic view of all team members when determining who meets the key talent criteria, which is why we require a certain scope when calibrating key talent and making final recommendations in the organization. There are several factors that can help determine the level at which key talent should be assessed, including things like reporting lines and span of control. As a general rule, if a people manager meets the following requirements, key talent calibrations should start at their level: The process to determine Key Talent is as follows: A very small portion of our business (roughly ~10% of the population) is considered to be key talent. As such, a team members’ value in the organization should not be determined based on whether or not they are identified as key talent. While some team members are identified as key talent, this does not mean the rest of our team is not valued and important to our organization’s success. Aligned with our expected performance distribution , approximately 60-65% of our team are core performers (or “performing” . Core performers are responsible for keeping things consistently moving forward. This group comprises the largest population in companies across the board for a reason and is an essential part of any organization’s success. We want to make sure we use engagement tools to retain Key Talent. A few of our primary engagement tools are: Learning & Development , growth opportunities and compensation. Note that being considered or designated as a key talent one year, does not mean or guarantee that a team member will be considered or designated as a key talent moving forward. Supporting Key Talent at GitLab is a critical element of business scalability and organizational development and growth. Our Key Talent are often individuals that can be looked to for mentorship and guidance by others, but it is also important that we invest in the development of this group and ensure that key knowledge is shared. A couple of key ways we can support our Key Talent is through regular discussions and the development of Individual Growth Plans (IGPs) . Below are suggestions for getting started, resources for managers, a Key Talent Engagement Discussion template , and a recommended cadence. One way to set up a structure and regular cadence for touchpoints with our Key Talent population is through Key Talent Engagement Discussions. We recommended these discussion focus areas are: Overall Engagement, Growth/Challenge, and Support Needed. The main goals for check-ins with this group include: Managers can leverage this template to help facilitate consistency in Key Talent Engagement Discussions. Key Talent Engagement Discussions can be a great starting point to start thinking through Individual Growth Plans, which is the recommended next step. Some ideas for our Key Talent population to consider when thinking through Individual Growth Plans (IGPs) include: We recommend that managers perform Key Talent Engagement Discussions twice per year, roughly every 5-6 months. Discussion timing is at manager discretion, as we want to ensure these discussions are held at the most relevant and impactful time for each team member. Key Talent Engagement Discussions are more geared towards stay interview format, and should not replace ongoing informal check-ins, regular feedback, and growth discussions that happen more regularly in 1:1s. A couple of options for Key Talent Engagement Discussions that managers can consider are: In FY'24 Q2, we will begin optional Key Talent Engagement Discussions across the organization aligned with our upcoming mid-year check-in process. For divisions or departments that choose to opt in, the high level timeline would be as follows (exact dates TBD): As mentioned above, Key Talent Engagement Discussions can be done at any point during the year, it is not necessary that they are coupled with our Mid year check-in process."

    "title": "Team Member Relations at GitLab",
    "paragraph": "The Team Member Relations team is responsible for facilitiating and resolving all people matter related team member issues. They will also assist in creating and informing team members of policies that are fair and consistent for all GitLab team members. As part of the People group the Team Member Relations team works with both the manager and team member in an intermediary function to understand and help resolve workplace issues. The Team Member Relations team can also help coach and advise managers and team members on policies and processes. Team member relation issues can range from simple coaching questions to serious code of conduct violations. We classify these different level of team member cases by tiers. Example of issues/cases by tier level: All Tier 3 cases will be managed together with Legal and the TMR team. Team members who would like to discuss a private matter should send an email requesting support from our Team Member Relations team to teammemberrelations@gitlab.com . Please include the following in your email: The Team Member Relations team will reach out within 24 hours from when the request was sent via email during the business week. GitLab also offers a Harassment Complaint Form that any team member may use to document any instance of any type of workplace harassment. Simply copy the form, fill it out with your information and send it to our Team Member Relations Specialist at teammemberrelations@gitlab.com . Team members and the TMR should both respond to questions or queries via slack or email within 24 hours to continue making progress on the issue and get to a timely resolution. For urgent requests that need immediate attention please ask for urgent assistance by sending a message marked URGENT to teammemberrelations@gitlab.com . If you do not receive support in a timely manner, below is the escalation path: An urgent request would be something that needs immediate attention like team members safety or a code of conduct violation. GitLab believes in preserving the dignity of each team member and expects everyone to treat others with fairness, respect, and transparency. We encourage mutual responsibility for constructive work relationships and communication, information sharing, problem solving and a safe neutral process through which differences can be resolved. Direct and honest communication is strongly encouraged between all team members regardless of title or level and per our values we do not pull rank . Such communication is likely to enhance understanding, avoid misunderstandings and create rapid solutions to concerns. We have built this philosophy to focus on these 4 pillars in line with our values: To support our team members, GitLab has established a Team member relations group to assist team members and their leaders with resolving work related issues. The Team Member Relations team (TMR) respects the privacy of all team members and treats discussions with the fullest degree of confidentiality possible. We have incorporated our Values and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics into our team member relations practices and philosophy. We believe that by communicating with each other directly and transparently, we can continue to resolve any difficulties that may arise and continue to make GitLab a great place to work. The team member relations function provides all GitLab team members an avenue to express workplace concerns and to resolve conflicts in a safe and unbiased forum. Team member relations provides guidance to managers in their efforts to improve team member performance or to correct unacceptable personal behaviors. Managers are responsible for setting priorities and motivating their team members. They are also responsible for ensuring the care of their team members as well as meeting GitLab’s goals. These two things can be done simultaneously. As managers it is considered one of your primary responsibilities to understand GitLab’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics , Values and People Group policies and processes. People managers are responsible for upholding compliance on the their teams and considering the best interest of the business. If a manager is made aware of a situation that potentially runs afoul of the Code of Conduct, Values and People Group processes or policy they should immediately reach out to the team member relations specialist . If uncertain about a specific policy or procedure, the manager should reach out to a leader, their aligned PBP or the Team member relation specialist for further clarification. When in doubt, it is always best to ask. A critical responsibility within the role of a GitLab leader is to spend the time required to truly understand the causes of the performance issue and how to address them properly. GitLab managers will determine if the performance concerns are skill-based or behavior (will)-based to determine next steps. Below are the definitions of both skill- and will-based performance concerns. Sometimes skill-based issues appear as a will-based or behavior concern. However, after delving into the cause for the behavior, the leader may find a skill-based gap causing the disruptive behavior. The team member may be embarrassed or concerned about their ineffectiveness or ability to perform their role and may react in a way that is inappropriate. The following are a few recommendations for a manager to address skill-based performance issues: If the team member is still not making progress after the manager has provided additional resources or coaching please review the underperformance page in the handbook for next steps. Will-based issues are described as undesirable behavior that impedes the success of the Team Member, the Team, and/or GitLab as a whole. The leader may hear about the behaviors from others or experience the undesirable behavior directly. It is important that the manager address the concerns right away. While “will” issues can be disruptive, there are different levels of severity which must be considered when determining next steps. The tiers below are examples and are not exhaustive, and should be used for comparision purposes to determine the impact to GitLab. Tier 2 - Misconduct resulting in limited material risk to GitLab For Tier 2 level concerns, the Manager should reach out and discuss with the team member relations specialist immediately. Tier 1 - Gross misconduct or a violation with serious implications to GitLab. Since situations differ, managers should immediately reach out to a team member relations specialist for guidance before taking any action. If unable to contact the team member relations specialist directly, please follow the escalation path listed in the handbook Please review the underperformance page in the handbook for further information regarding managing team member performance."

Don’t forget to update your username in the following places: Team members choose to manage their GitLab activities in different ways. Setup your notifications in a way that works best for you. The GitLab team-member resources project has a wiki for sharing among GitLab team-members . It’s for topics like parenting where people may want to share knowledge, but the handbook is not the best fit. @tipyn ’s home office equipment and macOS setup Link your GitLab email address to an easily recognizable photo of yourself on GitLab, Slack, and Gravatar . It is company policy to use a photo, and not an avatar, a stock photo, or something with sunglasses for any of your GitLab accounts, as we have a lot of GitLab team-members and our brains are comfortable with recognizing people; let’s use them. Note : If you upload your photo to Gravatar associated with your gitlab.com email, then you can simply not set an image in your GitLab and Slack profiles and they will automatically use your Gravatar photo. If you already uploaded individual photos to your GitLab and Slack profiles, simply removing them will cause your avatar to use the Gravatar photo by default. Mermaid is a tool that allows us to create flowcharts, graphs, diagrams, Gantt charts, etc. within GitLab! Check out the examples in the GitLab docs on how to use Mermaid. A few additional resources that can be helpful when working with Mermaid are: Note: When creating Mermaid charts in the GitLab handbook, you need to type three back tick symbols followed by the word mermaid before the chart, and three back tick symbols at the end of the chart. This will enable Markdown to distinguish between .md and Mermaid. Please reference the example Mermaid charts linked above to see how this looks live. If you are working on multiple GitLab instances and want to have a visual differentiation, you can change the default Navigation theme to a different color. Page counts are determined through a simple two-step process: Part of the maintainer training process is to keep track of Merge Request that have been reviewed and writing down an assessment on the review in the maintainer training issue. Manual upkeep of the maintainer training issue can be time consuming. There are tools that others have built to help with this task: Note: When using these tools, avoid adding mentions to maintainers in existing comments. There is a known issue where users are not notified by email when mentioned in an edited comment. It only generates a TODO which a maintainer may not use. Refer to the Handbook Development section to learn more about the architecture, structure and how to edit the handbook locally on your desktop. For how to edit the handbook in your browser, refer to the editing handbook page . Portions of the https://about.gitlab.com site lives in the www-gitlab.com repo. The marketing website is maintained by the digital experience team in their GitLab group . The data/*.yml files live in the www-gitlab-com repository, and are used by numerous sites including the marketing website and the handbook. The documentation for the site itself is in markdown documents under the doc folder in the repo . If you are looking to do local development on the site, doc/development.md is probably the best place to start. Many of the tips shown in this section require ImageMagick, an image manipulation tool. The installation is described in the ImageMagick section . ImageMagick provides the convert CLI command which can be used to resize images, add drop shadows, edit GIFs, etc. On macOS, install ImageMagick with Homebrew: On Linux, use your package manager: We have a dedicated section for that in the handbook. ImageMagick provides the convert CLI command which can be used to resize images. Our blog images do not need resolutions higher than 1920x1080. This saves bandwidth and makes the website load faster. This example converts an existing image to 1920x1080 resolution and replaces it inline: You can also use percentage values for the -resize parameter. The convert CLI command can do more things explained in the documentation . If you need to convert multiple images, combine the convert command with find . Note that this replaces the images inline. Tip: Modern macOS versions provide the Finder right-click menu Quick Actions > Convert Image which automatically converts an image to JPG. Use this method for quick UI conversions. ImageMagick provides the mogrify CLI command which can be used to convert the HEIC image format to other formats like JPG which are accepted on all websites. If you need to convert multiple images, combine the mogrify command with find . Note that this creates new files and requires manual cleanup of .heic|HEIC files, -iname uses a case insensitive match. An example shell alias can be found in @dnsmichi’s dotfiles project . Install ImageMagick and use the convert CLI command to add a drop shadow. The -shadow parameter may need adjustments on the dimension. If 2FA stops working unexpectedly (no new phone or computer) it’s usually because of improperly configured date & time on either device. Make sure that “Automatic Date & Time” is enabled on both devices. If they’re already enabled try toggling them off and on again to force an update. If this doesn’t work, request that IT Ops reset your 2FA setting. Links for finding the settings: For Android there’s no definitive link, since most vendors have different UIs for their settings. But in the Settings-app, look for “Date & Time” and there should be a “Automatic Date & Time” toggle. Netstat is a command line tool which can be useful to print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc. One of the most common uses for netstat during troubleshooting is to display a list of open ports listening for connections. sudo netstat -tulpn | grep -i listen If you find a port already in use, you won’t be able to successfully start up a service or program that utilizes that same port. Options to resolve are: When the GitLab Development Kit cannot start using the ./run command and Unicorn terminates because port 3000 is already in use, you will have to check what process is using it. Running sudo lsof -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P will yield the offender so this process can be killed. It might be wise to alias this command in your .bash_profile or equivalent for your shell. You may also wish to add a function in your .bash_profile (or equivalent file for your shell) like this: and it will kill whatever process is currently using port 3000. By adding this small configuration you will be able to view the git branch that you are using currently. If you are not inside a git repository, it only displays the username and the current directory. Add the following lines in your .bash_profile Doing the following, makes the changes to get reflected in you current terminal: On macOS Catalina, ZSH is the default shell . By installing Oh My ZSH! , the git plugin is automatically loaded and shows the current git branch. Add the following lines in your ~/.zshrc The changes will show on the next terminal or immediately by running. Use command aliases in your shell to speed up your workflow. Take a look at these aliases and others in Sid’s dotfiles project . For example, by adding the following to your .bash_profile or equivalent for your shell, you can just type s to checkout the master branch of this website, pull the latest changes, and open the repository in Sublime Text: After editing, you can just type gca to commit all of your changes, followed by gp to push them to the remote branch. If you are using Oh My ZSH! , you can add custom aliases shown below. You can freely define the file name, only the suffix .zsh is important. An example can be found in Michael Friedrich’s dotfiles project . In order to delete local Git branches which are deleted on the remote server, you’ll need to combine the --prune pull/fetch command with more commands. git branch -vv lists all details of local branches, the followed grep filters for all marked gone in the default remote origin and prints the results with awk . This argument is passed into git branch -d , and executed for all matching results. Note that -d does not delete unmerged branches. -D has more impact but can accidentally delete branches. Run the command without the final deletion command to see the potential affected branches. Note that \\$1 is shell escaped in the alias and needs to be executed as $1 . You can use dotfiles to customize your system, and keep all configuration in a central place. The name dot file is derived from Linux/Unix where all configuration files started with a dot, hiding them from the default list view ls . Team member dotfiles projects: Note: you have to pay for these items yourself. WorkFrom is a crowd-sourced resource of coffee shops and other such places that are remote-work friendly. When using unsecured Wi-Fi, consider a personal VPN. We don’t have a corporate VPN but consider purchasing a personal VPN if you travel for GitLab or use unknown networks often. Remember that if your job has restrictions based upon geolocation (for example supporting customers with specific data restrictions and country-based access), a personal VPN may not be the best choice as often the VPN vendor routes traffic through other countries. If this restriction applies to you, consider tethering. Tethering is when you set up your mobile phone as a hotspot and connect your laptop up to it via Wi-Fi, avoiding the unsecured Wi-Fi network. There is more information here on the subject, and as long as your data plan supports it, you should be good to go. Double check before international travel, as it may be supported but have hidden costs. When connecting to a network with a captive portal , most websites will not load as modern sites use HTTPS, and captive portals interrupt that process. Your device will try and compensate for this, but it can be tough to manage manually. If you have trouble, try connecting to https://captive.apple.com/ first, which is intentionally only HTTP and will load the captive portal. FIDO2 is a cryptographically strong 2FA (2-factor authentication) method. It is hardware-based, and is typically deployed via a USB, NFC, or built into a device such as a MacBook’s Touch ID or iPhone’s Face ID. The standard is open and is maintained by the FIDO Alliance . WebAuthn is a component of FIDO2 that supports verification by web applications using public key cryptography. FIDO2/WebAuthn is the preferred method of 2FA and is highly recommended by GitLab’s Security Department. One of the points of 2FA is that while you are authenticating with a username and password for the first factor, a secondary factor should use a separate - or “out of band (OOB)” - communication channel for the authentication. FIDO2/WebAuthn devices certainly meet that criteria, better than all other methods. There are other 2FA methods outlined below . During the authentication process, you enter in your username and your password. On systems with 2FA enabled and using FIDO2/WebAuthn, the hardware token is queried. By pressing a button or tapping a sensor on the FIDO2 device, the FIDO2 device completes the authentication process in a cryptographically strong way. It is generally considered the most secure form of 2FA. It is also more convenient than manually entering codes generated by a TOTP application. During the registration of the FIDO2/WebAuthn device, a public/private key pair is generated, with the public key being registered with the service you will be authenticating with, and the private key is stored on a secure chip in the device. When authenticating, after you’ve entered in your username and password, the device is queried via an encrypted message that can only be authenticated by the private key, so a button or sensor is pressed on the device to allow the query to be completed, and the user is then granted access to the system. YubiKey: The most popular FIDO2/WebAuthn device is Yubico’s YubiKey. There are a wide variety of sizes and styles of YubiKeys. Yubico (along with Google) helped develop the predecessor to FIDO2 standard (U2F) before it was moved to the FIDO Alliance. Most GitLab team members that have WebAuthn devices have a YubiKey. It should be noted that for a long time Yubico’s source code for its firmware was open source, but some of the newer versions of firmware are closed source. This has caused some concern in the security community, particularly those that prefer to use open source whenever possible. YubiKey has been examined by the security industry at large, third party audits and by the Security Team. YubiKey’s are more than suitable for use within GitLab and work fine with FIDO2/WebAuthn-compatible systems. YubiKey has had a number of security issues which are typically resolved quickly. They have a dedicated page for security advisories. In rare cases, a security issue involving a hardware token arises that requires the hardware token to be replaced as a firmware update will not mitigate the issue. This happened with Yubico in 2017 . Most of the attack models that impact the FIDO2/WebAuthn tokens require physical access to the token itself. That is, the security advisories involve coding issues that can only be exploited via access to the token or the computer that the token is plugged into. This in itself makes the devices more secure. While there are other hardware tokens that are also decent and will function with GitLab, some have limitations. The recommended solution for team members is Yubico’s YubiKeys. What GitLab team members need to keep in mind is that if you travel with your company laptop - either on a business trip, a trip to visit family and friends in another location but you intend to keep working, or just a trip to the local coffee shop - treat the token with the same level of care as a credit card. Do not leave it where it could be stolen. If you are concerned about potentially losing your hardware token, be sure to add Touch ID and potentially a mobile device as an accepted authentication token. Sites following the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard should support multiple tokens. That way if one is lost or stolen, you can still login use another method. Currently YubiKey’s are limited to one per user, in the case of lost or damaged, please reach out in the #it_security_help Slack channel and we’ll assist you with a replacement. Usage of 2FA is mandatory for GitLab team members. In addition to FIDO2/WebAuthn , there are additional protocols used for 2FA. There is “cryptographic push”, TOTP , and SMS-based authentication (text message). Pluses and minuses to each are listed below. This is usually shortened to simply “push technology”. It is called “push” because during the authentication process, after you’ve entered your username and password, the service you are authenticating with automatically “pushes” a secondary authentication via a separate communications channel to a device you possess. This is usually your phone, and it is facilitated via a phone app that is specific to that process. During the registration process a cryptographically-secure key pair is generated, and the app uses that key pair to uniquely identify the Push as coming from the service you are authenticating to. Typically the app then either directly notifies you or you access the app, which will pop up a message asking if you were in fact trying to authenticate. Answer yes and the authentication process is complete. GitLab team members may be familiar with this Push method as it is used by Okta Verify . This method is not quite as secure as a hardware token, as typically those devices stores data securely on the secure chip on the device itself. It is possible that the Push phone app is also storing secret data on the local secure chip on the phone, however the entire process is dependent on the service’s servers being up, and WebAuthn is more self-contained. But note that Push technology is still considered extremely secure, and once configured it is fairly convenient to use. Timed-based One-Time Password is fairly secure. This method involves a rotating value based off of a cryptographic seed that is used to uniquely identify communication between the service and the end user authenticating. The value is (usually) a six digit number that changes every 30 seconds, and during the authentication process after you’ve successfully entered in your username and password, you are asked to enter in the value. GitLab team members should use 1Password to manage TOTP codes. The main problem with TOTP is that during this 2FA process it typically involves the end user entering in all values through a single communications channel (usually a web browser). As this is the case, it is possible that an attacker could send you a fake web page for you to enter in your credentials, including your TOTP value. Granted, the attacker would have to be reading your replies and sending in all of your credential information extremely quickly and get the entire process completed with 30 seconds so the risk is greatly reduced, but it still exists. Both WebAuthn and Push are preferred over TOTP, but as long as you are the one initiating the communication and you are not clicking on a link in email, you should be okay. One of the more popular (and most common) methods of 2FA is SMS-based text messaging. It is similar to TOTP, but instead of using a locally-stored application to calculate the six digit number, the service you are authenticating to sends the six digits to you via an SMS text message. When you set up your account, you provide the service with your cell phone number so they know which phone number to send the six digits to. Due to the number of caveats, SMS is only recommended if there is no other 2FA option available. Here are the main problems with SMS messaging. There may be services that only offer SMS as their 2FA solution, so in those cases it is better than nothing. If this is the case, there are a few things you can do to secure things ever so slightly. Remember the purpose of 2FA - it is a secondary authentication method, invoked after the primary authentication method has succeeded. You should only acknowledge a 2FA request if you personally have just successfully completed the primary authentication. An unsolicited 2FA request means someone has your password, and is in the process of trying to log in as you. This is why 2FA exists, to help protect your user account from attacks involving your password. If you experience any such irregularities, please bring it to the attention of the Security Team.

The Google Calendar invite is the single source of truth for the Zoom link. Avoid linking the Zoom link in Google Document agendas since those may quickly become out of date. If the zoom link changed around the start of the meeting it is OK to have it in there temporarily. Need a new document or new slide deck quickly? Use shortcuts like https://doc.new or https://slide.new . The full list (not even restricted to Google products) is available at https://whats.new/shortcuts/ . See also Live Doc Meetings for more Google Doc tips. Google Analytics (GA) is an essential tool for making data-driven decisions. It receives data from both about.gitlab.com and docs.gitlab.com websites. Read through the Google Analytics Handbook for more information on GA. For example, you can look at the GA data to analyze how visited is a certain page, in a period of your choice. You can also look at the GA referrals data to understand where the users are coming from and where they go when they leave a certain page. Optional: Set your picture in Google so that your picture will show where you are in a Google document (vs showing just your first intial). This will allow others to more easily follow a discussion when meeting attendees move around in a document. Consider adding a phonetic pronunciation of your name and/or a pronunciation recording in your Google profile. Please make use of the Find a Time tab in Google Calendar, especially when scheduling events with teammates in other parts of the world: Find a Time presents a new or existing event’s time for all participants, adjusting for time zones as appropriate. To use Find a Time: For meetings spanning across multiple time zones and with external parties, Time & Date Calculator can help determine the best time to schedule. The GitLab Availability Calendar has been deprecated to allow for GitLab to scale effectively. We have created tools and tips for managing your time off . To help other team members to schedule meetings with you, you can set your normal working hours & location in Google Calendar . The preferred times will show up when someone tries to schedule a meeting with you. To set your working hours, go to Settings -> General -> Working Hours & Location . Working location can be set here or on your calendar directly by clicking on the pill in the All day row. In Settings there’s a helpful Copy to all option as well. Since all GitLab Team Members work remotely Home can be an ambiguous choice as folks may travel and it doesn’t provide any context on timezones. If you’d like, you can choose Somewhere else (in Settings) or Edit pencil -> + -> Another location (from the pill) to set this to something such as City, State, Country (GMT-#) and keep it up to date when traveling or timezones shift, which can help folks with planning and understanding timezones. The GitLab Team Meetings Calendar is available to all team members and can be found in your calendars list after it’s added. To add the GitLab Team Meetings Calendar to your list of calendars: Please reach out to a People Operations Team member if you have any questions. NOTE: Please do NOT remove any meetings from this calendar or any other shared calendars, as it removes the event from everyone’s calendar. You can find the details for the Company Calls, Group Conversations, 101s, and other teams’ meetings here, so you can attend a different teams’ meeting and ask questions, learn about what they’re working on, and get to know the rest of the GitLab Departments and teams. These meetings are open to everyone in GitLab. If you are creating a new team meeting, please add it to the GitLab Team Meetings calendar Please reach out to the People Operations Team via HelpLab with any questions, requests or changes to the GitLab Team Meetings calendar. Add an agenda or relevant content Under Add Guests, add GitLab Team Meetings in addition to anyone else you want invited (if you want the entire company invited please use everyone@).

You can change the default notification settings by calendar (add or remove notifications for all-day events, add a second default notification to all events...). This is accessible through Settings -> Settings for my calendars -> pick the calendar -> Event notifications and All-day event notifications . If you change the default notifications, all existing events will inherit that as well (unless their notifications have been customized). (This assumes you are using Google’s new Calendar ). When you have accidentally deleted something from the Team Meetings calendar, you can recover it by: We recommend enabling the ‘Show declined events’ setting if you are unable to attend a meeting but will still contribute to the agenda or attendance list asynchronously. Use this setting if it’s helpful for you to see declined meetings in your calendar view for any other reason. We recommend you set your Google Calendar access permissions to ‘Make available for GitLab - See all event details’. Team member calendars should not have access permissions set to ‘Make available to public’ due to the risk of sensitive data exposure and zoombombing . Consider marking the following appointments as ‘Private’: There are several benefits and reasons to sharing your calendar with everyone at GitLab: When setting up your Google Calendar be sure to set your working hours . If you’d like to share your calendar with e.g. your partner you can use the ‘Share with specific people’ feature and set the permissions to ‘See only free/busy (hide details)’: Enable speedy meetings to automatically provide a buffer at the end of events you schedule. This thoughtfully allows participants with back-to-back events the opportunity to use the restroom or grab a cup of coffee without being late to their next function. Add as many time zone world clocks as you wish by, in Google Calendar, going to Settings -> World Clock in order to see team members’ local times. You can also use sites like TimeAndDate to convert times to/from UTC for example. Check Display secondary time zone and select (GMT+00:00) Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This enables team members to standardize on a single time zone in communicating when meetings take place. See the Sandbox Cloud page for a listing of cloud resources and how to gain access to them. We would be remiss if we didn’t start this section off with this IMPORTANT message: Your default storage place for information that needs to persist and be available to others in the company should be ON THE WEBSITE/IN THE COMPANY HANDBOOK and not in Google Drive and Google Apps files!! This is from the top. This is how we operate, because Google Docs/Apps can only be found and contributed to by team members, and not by users, customers, advocates, future employees, Google handbook searches, or developers. Having said that, there is content which doesn’t make sense to be created on the website directly (e.g. large collections of data in tables, spreadsheets for calculations, etc) or for which Google Drive storage makes sense. When directing folks to these files in Google Drive please include name of the file in the handbook so that team members can search for it in Google Drive. If you link directly to the URL, people from outside the organization can request access, creating workload and the potential for mistakes. It is important that we not just throw files into random or general places in the shared Google Drives. Doing so makes it harder for others to find and work with the content. Here are some guidelines to organizing the Google Drive content: For starters, when your GitLab Google company account is created you automatically get a Google Drive with unlimited storage allocation in your own “home” directory (called My Drive). You can get to it by: This is great for storing your own working files. As already stated, this should never be the final resting place for shared files that are meant to be used by the rest of the company (or beyond). There are a few Google Drive repositories of GitLab shared files (there might be more, please add if not listed here): How do you use these? You don’t have to remember these URL’s. To add these links to your Google Drive My Drive directory, do the following: To really make your Google Drive easier to access, you can have your Google Drive show up on your Mac Finder as a regular drive. With this it is easier to store and view files such as videos, analyst reports (PDFs), etc. Use these GitLab branded form templates when creating internal or external surveys or forms. Make a copy of the form and only edit the copy; do not edit the template itself. Review what data privacy means at GitLab . Help participants make informed decisions by applying the following guidelines: If you use the archive function, you normally return to your overview. With Auto-advance you can select whether to advance to the next or previous message. “Auto-advance” can be enabled from the Advanced section under Settings. This reveals the Auto-advance settings in the General section under Settings. The default setting of showing the previous (older) message is usually preferred. -Set up an email signature which includes your full name and job title so people can quickly know who you are and what you do. -It is also an option to add your personal pronouns to your email signature. Note: You can copy and paste the template below to use it in your own signature. Alex Doe (they/them) Frontend Engineer | GitLab During onboarding you may have been asked to set up your GitLab Gmail and your email signature using the following example as a guideline . If you are employed by our German entity, you will need to add some company related details to the end of your email signature as set out here ( accessible internally to GitLab only ). Certain company details are required to be added as a signature to the forms of communication listed below, where that communication is going from a team member employed by our German entity GitLab GmbH to outside of the company, and relates to GitLab’s business activities: If you are sending such a communication, externally, please look at the setting of the relevant application and add the company details below to the end of the communication. If you are in doubt, please do add the details. If you are unable to add this information for any reason, please alert legal-employment@gitlab.com .

It might be useful to add a Gmail filter that adds a label to any GitLab notification email in which you are specifically mentioned, as opposed to a notification that you received simply because you were subscribed to the issue or merge request. You can create a Gmail filter that adds a label to any GitLab notification email in which you are assigned as a reviewer: You can create a Gmail filter that adds a label to any GitLab notification email in which an MR has been merged: GitLab issues and merge requests can generate a lot of email notifications depending on your settings and how in-demand your attention is. It can be useful to apply a label to these generated emails and move them out of your immediate inbox. You can learn more about how to use Gmail filters to organize your inbox in Productivity Hack video .

    "title": "Support Team Handbook",
    "paragraph": "The GitLab Support Team provides technical support to GitLab.com and Self-Managed GitLab customers. The GitLab Support Team Handbook is the central repository for why and how we work the way we do. Know someone who might be a great fit for our team? Please refer them to the job-family descriptions below. Remember, as members of the support team we are the first to interact with someone when they have a problem or question. As such it is up to us to represent the company and make sure we present ourselves properly. Therefore we are expected to: Our goal is to provide guidance that will lead to the best results for our customers as they use GitLab. In that, we will often point to documentation, product functionality, or open bugs/feature requests. However, there are times when customers will be best served through one of our commercial offerings. Support is part of the Engineering Department and Support Engineers are not commissioned or bonused for upsell for additional services, customer purchases, or lead generation. If you recommend Professional Services or moving to a different tier or offering you may link to this section in your recommendation to give the customer assurance you’re doing so with no mixed motivations. GitLab Support is part of the Engineering division . While most engineering departments are part of the R&D cost center, Support is part of the Cost of Sales (or sometimes Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)) cost center. This unique arrangement is expressed in our Key Performance Indicators , which are largely focused around pursuing customer success and satisfaction while driving efficiency by increasing output while keeping costs within a predefined range. This is also why Support Engineer responsibilities include contributing code and documentation and working alongside Product Managers on our products: By using the knowledge gained from interacting with our customers to make our products or docs better, we solve problems before they become one. This reduces support case load while increasing efficiency for the wider GitLab organization. For example, the Sales department can rely on our docs to answer customer queries instead of leaning on Support or Customer Success for help, freeing up more time to close sales. Part of Support’s role is to amplify the voice of the customer. One way of doing this is inviting other GitLab team members into experiences that will help them understand customer challenges with the product or our own obstacles in helping customers overcome those challenges. Before you start, make sure you get light-agent access in Zendesk so that you can view Support tickets. If you’re looking to get more exposure to customers, there are a few ways to get involved with Support: GitLab team members interested in learning about the GitLab Support team and our responsibilities are encouraged to participate in the Support Shadow Program. The Support Shadow Program is a way that team members outside of Support can spend time shadowing, learning, collaborating, and working together with the GitLab Support team. If you’re not part of the Support team and you’d like to participate in this program, open a Support Shadow Program issue in the support-team-meta project. This issue will be used to organize, plan, and track progress toward this program. GitLab Support uses Calendly to facilitate scheduling Shadow pairing sessions with participants. If you’re part of the Support team and you’d like to volunteer to host Support Shadow Pairing sessions with folks outside of Support, please open a Schedule update request issue requesting that Support Ops add you to the Support Shadow Program Calendly rotation. Support calls are published on the GitLab Support Calendar . There are: A great way to get involved is to join a customer emergency call. You can monitor #support_self-managed for PagerDuty alerts. Alternatively, if you have access to PagerDuty you can be scheduled into a shadow rotation . If you go through the responsibilities for each role in Support you can piece together how the organization works. We wanted to make a simple clear way to think about how the roles work together to solve problems: This simple list helps to give an easy way to set expectations and align problem solving in different roles. We use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to keep track of how well each Engineering Department is doing, including the Support team, as a whole. The KPI measurements can be found under the Reporting tab in Zendesk if you have the appropriate access, but progress on meeting these KPIs is also tracked via the aforementioned KPI link. We review these KPIs weekly in the Support Week-in-Review . In service of achieving our KPIs and OKRs, there are three key pillars that we must balance to achieve success: At various times it’s easy to over-optimize on one of the pillars to solve a problem, but considering all three is key to avoiding short-sighted decision making. The Single Source of Truth for information about Support Team Members - everything from email address and personal interests to product skills and group memberships - is the support-team project . The Support Team Home Page is built from the information in that project. Many other Support tools and automations make use of it also. See the Support team entry page of the Support Team wiki for details of the structure of an individual Support team member’s file. Information for and about the different parts of the Support Team can be found in the following sections of the Support Handbook: Below we also have some commonly referenced pages: GitLab Support’s vision is to deliver a consistent, “delightful” experience to our customers. Our team members will collaborate across all timezones to seamlessly deliver the results our customers care about while continuing to strengthen and scale the team. The overall direction for Support in FY25 will continue to build from the foundations laid in FY24. We will continue to focus on KPI achievement and evolve and iterate our approach to support, keeping the customer centered in our outcomes. Following on to the company’s overall strategic objectives, specific areas of focus are: While our publicly visible OKR page and Key Performance Indicators reflect the focus and progress for the current quarter, the following provides more detail on the items included in the themes for the entire FY25. FY24 was a challenging year in many aspects. As the workload and customer expectations grew, we needed to look at how we could improve efficiency and create a differentiated Support experience. FY25 is a year to focus and align on our customer needs and put our customers at the center of our understanding of their situations, perceptions, and expectations. To that end, we will: In FY23 / FY24 we moved towards dividing the team into globally distributed groups of engineers. In FY25 we’ll build on that foundation and extend towards differentiating support offerings to better align with customer requirements. This year, we will: As GitLab grows, Support’s influence within the company as advocates for customers must also grow. We need to continue to strengthen the Values-driven cultural attributes that promote efficient collaboration and results for customers while maintaining GitLab Support as a great place to work. In FY25 we will: FY24 was a year of better understanding the needs of our customers. In FY25 we will focus on delighting them. We will: Unlike typical companies, part of the mandates of our Security, Infrastructure, and Support Departments is to contribute to the development of the GitLab Product. This follows from these concepts, many of which are also behaviors attached to our core values : As such, everyone in the department should be familiar with, and be acting upon, the following statements: Citing our dogfooding operating principle, people sometimes ask why GitLab Support doesn’t use Service Desk . Dogfooding is using a piece of GitLab for its intended purpose . For example, one could use GitLab issues as a newsletter (and we do! See: Support Week in Review ), but creating merge requests to help Issues serve as a newsletter more effectively wouldn’t be dogfooding unless that improvement also helps its core use case. In other words: Dogfooding is using the product in the way that our customers would use it to the end of discovering and solving pain points that they have. Dogfooding supports customer results. At GitLab Support we use Service Desk to process Personal Data Requests , but not for our global support because the customer for Service Desk is primarily small teams soliciting bug reports, feature requests, or general feedback . Through our use of Service Desk in this smaller setting we’ve been able to influence product direction towards adding features like internal notes . We continually evaluate product features for use-cases within Support and provide feedback and feature requests where blockers exist. Support will always prioritize customer results over any other consideration. These were previously populated via a tool we are no longer using. TODO: Replace with current GitLab implementation The GitLab Support Team is part of the wider Engineering function. Be sure to check the communications section in the Engineering handbook for tips on how to keep yourself informed about engineering announcements and initiatives. Here are our most important modes of communication: Where we want to ensure that important messages are passed to the global support team, we will use this messaging template . This ensures that these messages are delivered across our communications channels in a structured and documented manner. We use the following GitLab Groups to notify or add support team members to issues and merge requests on GitLab.com. Our team projects and issue trackers can be found in the Support parent group . Here are some selected projects which are relevant to team communications. We use the Support meta issue tracker for tracking issues and creating issues that may require feedback around support. If you’re interested in working on a project or task related to support feel free to create an issue and link to any external issues or projects so that we can: Issues regarding documentation or features for GitLab, our FOSS project or any of the GitLab components should not go in this issue tracker, but in their appropriate issue tracker. If you have a proposed solution that is actionable, it’s best to start a merge request , tag the team for feedback and link in the Support Week in Review . We follow GitLab’s general guidelines for using Slack for team communications. As only 90 days of activity will be retained, make sure to move important information into the team handbook, product documentation, issue trackers or customer tickets. When naming channels, “spt” is meant for internal channels, meaning those that will be of use to the Support Team mainly. They should be public so others may join if they choose. If a channel has a “support” prefix, it is meant as a public interface where other teams will interact with the Support Team. The Support Daily Slackbot is an automated tool designed to facilitate daily standup Slack threads across various teams and regions at GitLab. It posts customized messages to specific Slack channels based on type and target. For further details of the different variations, please refer to the README file . At GitLab we are to be public by default unless there is a valid reason for it to not be public. While Slack is not public, the spirit of opening up discussions so that everyone can contribute means that private channels should be kept to a minimum. The following private channels are permanent fixtures in support. Usage estimates are approximate based on traffic in Feb 2022. Before starting a new private channel, ask yourself Why can’t everyone contribute here? Appropriate answers might be: Private channels are not appropriate for: Values are only values if you do them when it is hard. See more discussion on how to scale the business while preserving GitLab Values . If you need to be added to one or more of these groups, please open an issue in the access requests project . We use the following team calendars to coordinate events and meetings: Add these calendars to your GitLab Google calendar by clicking on the “+” sign next to “other calendars”, and choose “subscribe to calendar”. Enter the relevant ID mentioned above. If you need access to these calendars, ask a support team member for help. Please use the following formats for your name in Zoom as described in adding your title to your name in Zoom . As a primarily customer facing team, these formats were chosen to help identify you by vendor and role in calls where customers are present. For the sub-department, use the smallest unit you belong to. Again, bias for customer understanding over technical correctness. The Support Team has several meetings each week. These allow us to coordinate and help us all grow together. Each meeting has its own agenda and is led by a different member of the team each week. Discussions are encouraged to be kept in issues or merge requests so the entire team can collaborate, regardless of time zone. Any demos or announcements that need to be shared with the entire team should be shared in the Support Week in Review . All Zoom and agenda links can be found on the relevant calendar entry in the Support Calendar. . Support team members in some regions meet up regularly. Details of these calls are on the Weekly Support Team Call workflow page . The Support management team meets regularly. Details of these calls are on the Support Managers page The leadership team (Staff, Managers, Senior Managers, Directors) meet monthly to align on business objectives and cross-region collaboration. There is SAFE data shared, but a read-out is disseminated for wider team awareness. Some regional Support teams have meetings oriented around company news, Support initiatives, training plans, and connectedness. Senior and Staff Support Engineers are encouraged to host office hours. These office hours are intended to strengthen the team through mentoring. It is up to each Senior/Staff Support Engineer whether they schedule office hours, and how often. Please see the “GitLab Support” Team calendar to view office hours and invite yourself. We encourage hosts to include what they will cover in the calendar event description and optionally a document to track. Some ideas of what one can expect at a Senior/Staff Support Engineers’ office hour: You may wish to host a sync call. To do so, you can create an event on the Support Calendar. . To invite team members to the event, you can use the appropriate Support email alias (internal Handbook, GitLab team members only) Every Friday, we do a week in review, inspired by the greater Engineering organization week in review . You can add topics any time by using the SWIR topic form . Any workflow changes or announcements should be shared in the SWIR and we recommend you check at least once a week to stay up to date on recent changes. Ideally, the information shared here should have a permanent location such as an issue or merge request. We encourage anyone in the team to share. We currently have the following topics, each in its own section in the SWIR: SWIR Issues can also have their own Tags or Labels in the GitLab project. These are used to highlight specific Areas of Focus (L&R, SaaS...). Labels are used on the Issues only, they do not appear in the digest Issue nor in the Google doc. One label, Manager Attention , is used for policy changes or other topics of which Support Managers should specifically be made aware. You can find the Manager Attention label here ] and subscribe to it. You can read about the origins of the auto-generated SWIR in this issue . The Support Team collaborates with many other departments throughout GitLab - Sales, Channel, Product and Legal, to name a few. And we have created two different roles to help those collaborations to be as effective and efficient as possible. The Support Stable Counterpart role is designed to provide a strong connection between a product or non-product team and Support. The purpose is discussing product issues, sharing product knowledge and representing customer needs, as well as sharing knowledge about each team’s work and developing processes and documentation to allow the two teams to work together well. If you are interested in becoming a Support Stable Counterpart, or would like to learn more about the role, read the Support Stable Counterparts page. The Support Team records our institutional knowledge, processes and workflows in multiple places, such as the handbook and project issues templates. When updating such documents, make sure to have visible artifacts of approval on your merge requests before merging even if you have received approval somewhere else. This avoids the impression of changes being made without any oversight or accountability. Artifacts of approval can include: Each Slack channel within Support has a number of Workflows attached to them that are used to provide information to users. The source files for each workflow live in the slack-workflows project. Some workflows are meant to notify the team of new issues created in the relevant project. In these cases, a project webhook passes information to Zapier , which then sends the information to a Slack workflow. Providing information by reacting to a message with a specific emoji. See the Support Onboarding page After getting promoted, make sure to update your title in: Consider updating the title on Slack and on Zoom, following the guidelines in Zoom name format . In GitLab Support, we use Support Pods to organize support engineers as they work. Each Support Pod is a cross-region, single skill group of engineers who are interested in their Support Pod’s specific product area. They are engineer- lead. To join or start a Support Pod you can read more below. See the Support Pods handbook page and the Working with Support Pods workflow page . The Support team uses ‘support-team-meta’ project issues to track ideas and initiatives to improve our processes. The ‘Active Now’ issue board shows what we’re currently working on. It uses three labels: Some principles guide how these labels are used: Each week we look at the board and discuss the issues to keep things moving forward. By keeping a maximum of six issues for each label, we limit work in progress and make sure things are completed before starting new tasks. Adding and managing items on the board: Support managers will regularly review the board to keep items moving forward. The Support Slackbot (archived) has been retired."

For all other queries, please see the getting assistance page. Initiatives driven within the Platforms section, often spanning multiple quarters, are represented on the SaaS Platforms section epic (GitLab team member). Unlike typical companies, part of the mandates of our Security, Infrastructure, and Support Departments is to contribute to the development of the GitLab Product. This follows from these concepts, many of which are also behaviors attached to our core values : As such, everyone in the department should be familiar with, and be acting upon, the following statements: (click the boxes for more details) The Infrastructure Platforms department uses GitLab and GitLab features extensively as the main tool for operating many environments , including GitLab.com. We follow the same dogfooding process as part of the Engineering function, while keeping the department mission statement as the primary prioritization driver. The prioritization process is aligned to the Engineering function level prioritization process which defines where the priority of dogfooding lies with regards to other technical decisions the Infrastructure Platforms department makes. When we consider building tools to help us operate GitLab.com, we follow the 5x rule to determine whether to build the tool as a feature in GitLab or outside of GitLab. To track Infrastructure’s contributions back into the GitLab product, we tag those issues with the appropriate Dogfooding label. At GitLab, we have a handbook first policy . It is how we communicate process changes, and how we build up a single source of truth for work that is being delivered every day. The handbook usage page guide lists a number of general tips. Highlighting the ones that can be encountered most frequently in the Infrastructure Platforms department: Classification of the Infrastructure Platforms department projects is described on the infrastructure department projects page . The infrastructure issue tracker is the backlog and a catch-all project for the infrastructure teams and tracks the work our teams are doing–unrelated to an ongoing change or incident. In addition to tracking the backlog, Infrastructure Platforms department projects are captured in our Infrastructure Platforms department Epic as well as in our Quarterly Objectives & Key Results The Infrastructure Library contains documents that outline our thinking about the problems we are solving and represents the current state for any topic, playing a significant role in how we produce technical solutions to meet the challenges we face. Infrastructure maintains a Technical Roadmap for planning projects over the short (1y), medium (2y), and long term (3y). This serves as our strategic compass, helping us balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability. The Technical Roadmap is based on the Product Roadmap , where Product provides the “What” (customer needs) and “Why” (business strategy). Engineers then determine the “How” (technical implementation), while Engineering Managers plan the “When” (scheduling). This comprehensive roadmap emphasizes building high-quality, complete features in a sustainable manner. The Technical Roadmap serves three key purposes: It helps build engineering excellence by addressing critical areas that might not show up in product backlogs, such as technical debt, performance improvements, platform improvements, and system scalability. It enables the department to be proactive rather than reactive. By regularly asking key questions like “Where do we see the biggest instability in our systems?” or “What is generating the most toil?”, we can address issues before they become critical problems. This helps maintain our SLOs and keeps our customers happy. It aligns engineering efforts with business goals, ensuring technical improvements drive GitLab’s success. Each technical roadmap item is prioritized based on business value and strategic alignment. The Infrastructure Roadmap is maintained as a static site. GitLab team-members can review the current technical roadmap, at infra-roadmap.gitlab.com . NOTE : The Infrastructure Roadmap is not publicly available as some of the projects and initiatives may be considered unSAFE . The site presents the roadmap in a visual manner, showing: Changes to the Roadmap are made through merge requests to the infra-roadmap project. The data is stored in YAML format, and changes can be made by editing the YAML. This allows for version control and collaborative discussion through the merge request process. Full instructions for making changes to the Infrastructure Roadmap are available in the project’s README.md . Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the roadmap, whether proposing new initiatives or making smaller changes like updating descriptions or adding links to relevant issues. We have a model that we use to help us support product features. This model provides details on how we collaborate to ship new features to Production. Our main method of communication is Slack. If you need assistance with a production issue or incident, please see the section on getting assistance . The SaaS Platforms group is gradually directing requests for help to the #saas-platforms-help Slack channel. This channel can be used if it is unclear which Infrastructure team the question should be directed to. For more information, refer to the landing page for getting assistance . The #saas-platforms-help channel is monitored by SaaS Platforms Engineering Managers and Staff+ engineers who triage any inbound requests. When triaging this channel, one should locate the team who can best answer this question and instruct the requestor to contact that team using the team’s preferred contact method. When the requestor is connected to the right team, add a green check emoji to the message. Finally, if needed, update the getting assistance page with any changes. Once per week, we hold a Platforms leads call to align on action items related to career development, general direction or answer any ongoing questions that have not been addressed async. The call is cancelled when there are no topics added on the morning of the call. In addition to the Platforms leads call , we have some recurring events and reminders that can be viewed in the SaaS Platforms Leadership Calendar . Please add this to your Calendars to stay up-to-date with the various events. Sr. Director of Infrastructure Marin Jankovski, likes to meet with new team members that join the organization. Marin sets up informal 1:1 coffee chats a few times a month with newer team members to get to know one another and see how they are doing. This process is organized by their EBA who will reach out to team members once they has the availability to meet. As this is a large team, it may take a while to get through everyone. If someone needs to meet with Marin sooner than when the coffee chat is scheduled, you can reach out to their EBA Liki Simonot to set something up. The Engineering Leads for each Stage, along with their Product Managers, hold weekly progress reviews to assess their groups’ progress, share project updates, resolve blockers, and celebrate wins. Additionally, the Director of Product and the Senior Director of Infrastructure Platforms conduct a higher-level leadership review, where they go over summaries from these group-level meetings. The review is private streamed to the GitLab Unfiltered channel because the review covers confidential issues. All recordings are made available in the Platforms Grand Review YouTube Playlist The Infrastructure Platforms Leads Demo is an opportunity for sync discussions between Staff+ IC across the Infrastructure Platforms Group to highlight current ongoing efforts underway in the teams they support. All team members are welcome to join the call, but the emphasis is on Staff+ ICs to present and discuss the work they’re focused on, the problems they’re experiencing, and solutions they’re considering. The call is recorded to the Infrastructure Platforms Leads Demo Unfiltered Playlist . The agenda can be found in Google Docs . While the intention is for the call to be made public on GitLab Unfiltered, the default is for it to be published as private. At the end of the call, a quick vote is held between the attendees and if all agree that the content is #SAFE, it can be published as public. On the landing page for getting assistance , we ask team-members who need assistance to raise Requests for Help using standard templates. These issues are raised in the request for help issue tracker and are automatically assigned to the Engineering Manager of the relevant SaaS Platforms team. The Engineering Manager is expected to: In an effort to enhance the tracking and resolution of requests directed to the Infrastructure team, we are evaluating a bot that converts Slack messages in #infrastructure_lounge channel into GitLab issues. Agents responsible for handling these issues are defined in a JSON file, which serves as a CI/CD variable . Currently, this file contains a static list of all members of the infrastructure department. We use epics and issues to manage our work. Our project management process is shared between all teams in SaaS Plaforms. The Platforms section builds and maintains various tools to help deploy, operate and monitor our SaaS platforms.

The term “Product” is interpreted broadly and includes the GitLab application itself and all other integrations and code that is developed internally to support the GitLab application for the multi-tenant SaaS. Our responsibility is to ensure all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to the highest security standards, and to be proactive and responsive to ensure world-class security in anything GitLab offers. Security Operations Department teams are primarily focused on protecting GitLab the business and GitLab’s platform. This encompasses protecting company property as well as to prevent, detect and respond to risks and events targeting the business and our platform. This department includes the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and the Trust and Safety team. These functions have the responsibility of shoring up and maintaining the security posture of GitLab’s platform to ensure enterprise-level security is in place to protect our new and existing customers. Threat Management Department teams are cross-functional. They are responsible for collaborating across the Security Division to identify, communicate, and remediate threats or vulnerabilities that may impact GitLab, our Team Members or our users and the community at large. The Security Assurance Department is comprised of the teams noted above. They target Customer Assurance projects among their responsibilities. This reflects the need for us to provide resources to our customers to assure them of the security and safety of GitLab as an application to use within their organisation and as a enterprise-level SaaS. This also involves providing appropriate support, services and resources to customers so that they trust GitLab as a Secure Company, as a Secure Product, and Secure SaaS GitLab is both a company and a product. The Corporate Security department focuses on implementing and protecting the information technology (IT) related systems that the company uses to conduct business internally, and provides the hardware, software, and tools that our team members and 3rd party service providers (aka contractors) need to be productive and get their job done efficiently. The configurations that we implement for team members internally are designed to protect our customers and their data. We have a 24x5 technical support helpdesk for team members and have engineers that configure and maintain many of our company-wide tech stack applications . We invest heavily in device trust, identity management, and infrastructure governance to provide the highest level of security assurance for the administrators of our product and ensure all appropriate controls are in place when handling customer data. Security Program Management is responsible for complete overview and driving security initiatives across Product, Engineering, and Business Enablement. This includes the tracking, monitoring, and influencing priority of significant security objectives, goals, and plans/roadmaps from all security sub-departments. Security Program Manager Job Family In keeping with our core values and the belief that everyone can contribute , the Security Division is committed to dogfooding and contributing to the development of the GitLab product.

At GitLab, product security encompasses a broad range of cybersecurity disciplines that enable product and engineering teams to design, develop, deploy, maintain, and refine GitLab’s technologies securely. This goes beyond the conventional confines of security, covering everything from protecting developer workstations to ensuring the integrity of our production environments. Our mission is to set the standard for product security by fostering a culture of rapid innovation and secure product delivery. We are committed to leveraging the GitLab platform, embodying the pinnacle of internal usage (‘dogfooding’) practices. By maintaining close collaboration with product teams and contributing significant security features and capabilities to the GitLab codebase, we aim to enhance our operations and be a vital driver of the broader GitLab vision. Our comprehensive, multi-year product security mission can be found in our internal handbook. Our Product Security Risk Register process details can be consulted on this dedicated page . Success in product security is not confined to PSD or even the Security Division. It requires a concerted effort across the entire GitLab ecosystem. Collaboration is crucial, involving not just our security counterparts but the broader organization. Key disciplines and capabilities, from Security Operations to Site Reliability Engineering, while not directly under PSD’s purview, are vital to our strategy’s success. The Product Security sub-department includes the following teams. Learn more about each by visiting their Handbook pages. The Product Security Department has standardized its labeling system to improve issue tracking, team identification, and cross-team collaboration across all security teams. All issues, epics, and merge requests within the Product Security Department must include the “Division::Security” and “Department::Product Security” labels.

You should be able to find answers to most of your questions in the sections below. If you cannot find what you are looking for, then please connect with us: Vendor Invoices - These invoices are processed in Coupa either PO Backed or Non PO backed. Vendors must be set up or onboarded in Coupa and invoices must contain all required information like Invoice Number, Invoice Date, Payment Terms, PO Number, Invoice Amount, Currency, and Service Dates/Period to proceed with processing. Quotations, Order Forms, Agreements, Contracts are not valid for invoice processing, only “Invoice” is allowed. Payroll Invoices - These are invoices provided by the Payroll Team for processing and will be manually input in Netsuite. Approval signatures are indicated on the invoice. Special Invoices - Mostly these are related to reimbursements (e.g. Speaker Reimbursement, Interview Candidate Reimbursement, Ex-Team Member Reimbursement and BOD Reimbursements). GitLab’s preferred method of payment for suppliers is electronic funds transfer with supplier invoice provided as supporting documentation. In the instances where this option is not available with the supplier, Virtual Card , which is a temporary credit card, can be used as an alternative payment method.

Please find our internal processes in the Accounting and Reporting internal handbook section. Calculated billings is defined as revenue plus the sequential change in total deferred revenue as presented on the balance sheet. We do not believe that calculated billings provides a meaningful indicator of financial performance as billings can be impacted by timing volatility of renewals, co-terming upgrades and multi year prepayment of subscriptions. For order approval and invoicing process please view the Billing Ops page. To amend a customer’s account, choose one of the options below from the subscription page in Zuora. Zuora Subscription Data Management New Accounts vs New Subscriptions There are instances where a new account in Zuora is required rather than just a new subscription in an existing account. This is determined by the sold-to contact person. Within the customer account portal, customers can only see a single Zuora account at a time. If a customer wants to add a subscription and the contact information is the same, then the subscription can be added to the existing account. If a customer wants an additional subscription for a different sold to contact, then a new Zuora account will be created so that every sold to contact can log into the portal and manage their subscriptions. When a customer renews their subscription, a new subscription is typically created. This can create challenges for calculating metrics like dollar retention for a subscription because once subscription has ended and another has started. To address this, a linkage is made between the original subscription and its renewal(s). The field Renewal subscription is used to create the mapping. These are the following constraints on this field: The process to make the linkage is as follows: The active subscription status in Zuora needs to be reviewed in connection to the end date. If the end date is in the future it means that the subscription is still within the term and the customer is able to use the product. An ‘active’ subscription with an end date in the past means that the subscription was not renewed and the customer doesn’t have access to the product since the end date. We currently don’t actively cancel these subscriptions as this is a manual process and the cancellation or lack of it does not have any impact on other processes. Additionally, where subscriptions remain in an active status they can be renewed by the customers on the CustomersDot For step by step processes please view Billing Ops page. How to process a partial refund in Stripe Posting Swag Shop transactions in NetSuite Transactions from the Swag Shop are remitted to the Comerica checking account daily and should be booked in NetSuite at the end of each month. Accounting for customer collections Follow this procedure if the customer paid by credit card. You may recall from the invoicing process that there was still a balance due when saving the invoice. The following steps will record the payment and remove the balance due. Login to Stripe dashboard and click on Payments under Transactions (left hand side). You will see a listing of the latest Stripe transactions listed by amount, Recurly transaction, name, date, and time. There is also an option to filter the report by clicking on XXX at the top left. Click on XXX to export to excel. This will give you a workbook area and also a breakdown of the fees which we will work on later. In NetSuite, click on the “Transactions” tab on the left. Match invoice #s between the Stripe dashboard and NetSuite. If you click on a transaction in the Stripe dashboard, it will take you to a screen that shows more detail, including the invoice # being paid. You can work your way from the bottom up. In NetSuite, click “Receive Payment” on the matched payment and invoice. Post a journal entry to record Stripe Fees. This transaction transfers the payment obligation from the customer to Stripe. The payment obligation from Stripe is removed when Stripe transfers the funds to GitLab’s bank account.

Procure to pay is the process of requisitioning, purchasing, receiving, paying for and accounting for goods and services. It includes the following sub processes of both the Procurement and Accounts Payable departments: Coupa is a procure-to-pay system that streamlines the purchase request process, initiate workflow with approvals, and enable Purchase Orders. We will be rolling out in a phased approach, with the US and Netherlands entities (GitLab Inc, Federal, IT BV and BV) in Phase I (2021-06-01). The remaining entities will be part of Phase II (2021-12-13). You can learn more about Coupa on our FAQ Page How vendors are added into Coupa: Entering a Bill (invoice) in NetSuite Please note the below steps reference how to manually enter bills into NetSuite. Effective 2019-11-01 all AP invoices were processed through Tipalti. Effective 2021-06-01 (Coupa Phase I) and 2021-12-13 (Coupa Phase II), AP invoices will be processed in Coupa. These systems will automatically record the transaction into NetSuite after the invoice has been approved by the corresponding business partner in the respective system. Coupa is a Procurement and Invoicing Tool. Similarly to purchase requests for goods/services that must be initiated in Coupa, invoices are also created and approved in Coupa. Invoices in Coupa can be created via 4 different channels: A NetSuite error log identifying invoice integration issues will be emailed to the Accounts Payable Team every Tuesday and Friday. The email is sent from Finance Systems Admins and the Subject is Coupa2NS Invoices - Integration Log . Download the attached file and filter by Type = Error and Audit . Review the Details field to find the invoice number/document number that needs to be reviewed/corrected. For information regarding common errors and how to correct them, please review this file ; under the column labeled Script search for Coupa Invoice Integration . If any troubleshooting assistance is needed, please ask in the #coupa_help Slack channel. There is also a View in Coupa that will list invoices not exported to NetSuite. Under Invoices, select View = Not Exported However, there will be no details regarding the integration issue. You will need to review the NetSuite error log (referenced above) for the details. Invoices requiring PO receipts or approval will appear in user’s To Do list within Coupa. Users will also receive email notifications from Coupa (depending on user’s notification setting in Coupa). PO receipts notifications will enable users to “Create Receipt” by clicking on the button and entering the quantity received and receipt date. Please watch the End Users training video (starting at the 30:15 mark) for more information. Approval notifications will enable users to reject or approve invoices by clicking on the appropriate button. Verify invoice copy is attached Verify correct PO is matched Verify coding (Billing) is correct Verify service date is entered and correct Verify tag/class is entered (if applicable) Verify invoice total is correct If there are issues with any of the above items, please tag @Accounts Payable Approval Group in the Comments section with details. If there are issues with any of the above items, please tag @Accounts Payable Approval Group in the Comments section with details. The invoice dispute process in Coupa enables the Accounts Payable team to request corrections on invoices from suppliers. Invoices in “AP Hold”, “Pending Action”, “Pending Receipt”, “On Hold”, “Pending Approval” or “Rejected” statuses can be disputed to the supplier for corrections. Disputing an invoice requires a dispute reason and sends an email notification to the supplier contact on record and any additional listed recipients. Once disputed, an invoice can be Withdrawn from Dispute by Accounts Payable or Voided; or Resolved by the supplier. The invoice rejection process in Coupa allows the Accounts Payable team to make adjustments on invoices before restarting approvals, continuing approvals or disputing the invoice back to the supplier. This is an internal status that suppliers cannot see indicating that an approver or approval group rejected the invoice. Comments are required when rejecting an invoice - please provide as much detail/information as possible. Please note the below steps reference how to manually enter bills into NetSuite. Effective 2019-11-01 all AP invoices should be getting processed through Tipalti and Effective 2021-06-01 we will begin to process in Coupa as well. These 2 systems will automatically record the transaction into NetSuite after the invoice has been approved by the corresponding business partner in the respective system. If adding a new vendor, follow the bullets below before proceeding, otherwise skip to step 3 If you have an expense report that can be billed back to a customer please make sure to check the “billable” flag in Navan along with tagging the customer name under the “customer” field in Navan. Supplier Payment Accounts (SPAs) are required in order to pay suppliers from Coupa Pay. There are four different ways that suppliers will be able to provide their payment information: After the supplier submits their supplier payment account information, it will transfer into Coupa automatically and create a supplier payment account record. For more information regarding how to set up SPAs or Coupa Pay, please check out the lower section of our Coupa FAQ page . A NetSuite error log identifying payment integration issues will be emailed to the Accounts Payable Team every Tuesday and Friday. The email is sent from Finance Systems Admins and the Subject is Coupa2NS Pay Payments Integration Log . Download the attached file and filter by Type = Error and Audit . Review the Details field to find the payment number that needs to be reviewed/corrected.

If any troubleshooting assistance is needed, please ask in the #coupa_help Slack channel. There is also a View in Coupa that will list payments not exported to NetSuite. Under Payments, select View = Not Exported Coupa is available via Okta. To access the platform: If your job function requires you to submit purchase requests in Coupa, follow the below steps: Due to the limited number of licenses available for Coupa, it is recommended that each department identify power users responsible for creating purchase requests on the team's behalf. Please refer to GitLab’s Expense Policy for further details. Entites included: GmbH, BV, PTY LTD, Ireland, IT BV and GK. Further details on the Expense reimbursement process can be found here Average days to action <= 3 business days Number of days from when an team member’s manager approves report to when AP analyst does final approval for payment or responds to team member in Navan if there is a concern. (Approval for payment is not the reimbursement date.) This is calculated on a calendar month basis. The target for this is currently three business days. Time to get a new team member set up in Navan < 3 business days Have new team member set up in Navan within 3 business days from team member start date. When reducing spend, we will not take the easy route of (temporarily) reducing discretionary spending. Discretionary spending includes expenses like travel, conferences, gifts, bonuses, merit pay increases and summits. By reducing in these areas we put ourselves at risk of increasing voluntary turnover among the people we need most . Discretionary spending is always subject to questioning, we are frugal and all spending needs to contribute to our goals. But, we should not make cuts in reaction to the need to reduce spend; that would create a mediocre company with mediocre team members. Instead, we should do the hard work of identifying positions and costs that are not contributing to our goals. Even if this causes a bit more disruption in the short term, it will help us ensure we stay a great place to work for the people who are here. In order to purchase goods and services on behalf of the company, you should first consult the Signature Authorization Matrix to determine the approval requirements. Note that this does not include travel expenses and other incidentals. These expenses should be self-funded then submitted for reimbursement within Navan, or in the case of independent contractors, included in invoices to the company (per the guidelines above). If further approval is not required, then proceed to the Procurement “What are you buying” page for further instructions on the purchasing process at GitLab. Once those procedures are complete, have your vendor send their invoice to Accounts Payable: ap@gitlab.com . Most importantly, the team member making the purchase request is ultimately responsible for final review and approval of the invoices. Final review and approval are critical process controls that help ensure we do not make erroneous payments to vendors. All original invoices and payment receipts must be sent to Accounts Payable. If you would like to track spend for a particular campaign, project and/or event you can do that through expense tag, also known as classes in NetSuite. If you would like to request an expense tag/class to be set up please open this tracker and enter the information required for the General Ledger (GL) team to create the tag. Navan will auto-sync any new “expense tags” on a daily basis, but if the Navan admin wants to manually sync they can do so by following these steps: Import new Classes/Tags In Navan: Please review this page for the current policy/procedures. Please see the campaign expense guidelines in the Marketing handbook . Tracking expenses for company Contributes enables us to analyze our spend and find opportunities to iterate, and in turn, improve subsequent Contributes. To enable tracking we create an expense tag that will allow GitLab team-members to tag Contribute related expenses in Navan. This should be done prior to the announcement of each Contribute. Property, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet. Following are the sub-processes: This policy establishes the minimum cost (capitalization amount) used to determine the capital assets recorded in GitLab’s financial statements. A “Capital Asset” is a unit of property that has an economic useful life extending beyond 12 months and was acquired (or in some cases, produced) for a cost of $5,000 (USD) or more. Capital Assets must be capitalized and depreciated for financial reporting purposes. GitLab establishes $5,000 (USD) as the minimum amount required for capitalization. Any item with a cost below this amount is expensed on the date of purchase. Exceptions are Key Component Assets (i.e. computer laptops). Bulk purchases (“like” items acquired with a single purchase order, which are received within a reasonable period of time of one another (less than 60 days) and that individually have an Acquisition Cost less than the Individual Purchases Capitalization Threshold) have a Capitalization Threshold of $50,000 (USD) All capital assets are recorded at historical cost as of the acquisition date. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, with the number of depreciation periods being determined by asset class. Invoices and purchase receipts for capital assets are retained for a minimum of five (5) years. Items paid for by the company are property of the company. Assets with purchasing value in excess of $5000 USD or Key Component Assets are recorded and tracked through NetSuite Fixed Asset Management (FAM) module, which includes details of individual asset purchased. The Asset Register report provided by NetSuite FAM provides each individual asset purchased with the following information: Once the information is captured in NetSuite FAM a depreciation schedule will populate and NetSuite FAM will post a journal entry each month to record the depreciation of the asset until it is fully depreciated. The asset will remain on GitLab’s balance sheet until the asset is no longer being used and is identified to be disposed. Assets will be disposed of if purchased by an employee upon termination (if approved by IT Ops) or if the item is no longer useful before the useful life. IT Ops will need to identify the asset and inform Accounting to properly dispose of the asset from NetSuite FAM. Record to report process is governed by the following accounting policies: Refer to Legal page for Related Party Transactions policy Our ability to accomplish our Finance and Accounting mission of providing timely, fact-based information to drive business results as a public company depends on the participation of team members during certain critical times of year. Our accounting function provides critical, time based deliverables that directly impact our ability to support business growth and meet our public company obligations. These activities require the entire team’s support. Team Members should prioritize taking time off to refresh and recharge outside of these critical windows. While these exact windows vary by team, generally we need all team members to support the last week of the quarter and first two weeks of the next quarter. Check with your manager if you are unsure what is applicable to your role. When these windows overlap a weekend (particularly the last day of the quarter) or public holiday/ Family and Friends day, we recommend team members work with their manager to reschedule the day off to a day outside of this critical end of quarter time period. If a team member is unavailable to work during this time period, they should provide their manager with at least one months’ notice whenever possible to allow for coverage to be arranged. When appropriate, we will create rotational coverage plans over holidays/weekends, while remaining in line with applicable jurisdictional requirements. The purpose of this policy is to establish the responsibility, authority and guidelines for the investment of operating surplus cash. Surplus cash is defined as those funds exceeding the operating requirements of the Company and not immediately required for working capital or near term financial obligations. This policy shall apply to the Company and all subsidiaries. This investment policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with the overall objectives of the Company and with current financial trends. Approved Brokerage Institutions The Company may use the following brokerage institutions: The basic objectives of the Company’s investment program are, in order of priority: United States Government Securities: Money Market Funds must be rated AAA or equivalent by at least one NRSROs. At time of purchase investment restrictions: Investment Products (Rating, Sector Concentration, Issuer Concentration) This policy describes the methodology used to monitor and account for GitLab’s prepaid expenses. A Prepaid Expense arises when a cash disbursement is made for goods and services prior to realizing the associated benefits of the underlying goods and services. These transactions are recorded as assets until the goods and services are realized, at which point an expense is recorded. Our minimum threshold for recording prepaid expenses is $5,000 USD Identification and Recording of Prepaid Expenses Once a purchase request makes it through the company approval workflow , Accounting will take the following steps to ensure prepaid expenses are recorded accurately: The amount involved is equal to or exceeds $5,000 . Prepaid expenses below $5,000 must be recorded as period expense immediately as incurred. The prepayment is for a time period greater than 12 months ; (period of time is excluded for the Deposit of an event) if an amount is equal or greater than $50,000 on a single item in one invoice, it can be capitalized if the prepayment time period spans across fiscal quarters . Any deposits made for events in Marketing, Corporate or other departments of less than $5,000 USD will be recognized as an expense immediately on the day the invoice is received regardless of whether the event has taken place or not. The $5,000 clip level normally applies per invoice or per item. However, situations may exist that would require exercising business judgement on a case by case basis (i.e. any clip level by total amount of purchase per vendor). Also, there are situations when each individual prepaid may not meet the clip level but as a whole, these prepayments are similar in nature and are purchased in a bulk and therefore, the total amount of all the prepaid should be combined and used to decide if the prepayment should be recorded. Any exceptions should be pre-approved by the Corporate Controller or PAO. Amortization is recorded straight line based on a mid-month amortization method as follows: If the first month of service begins on the 1st to the 15th of the month, a full month amortization will be recorded in the current month. If the first month of service begins on the 16th to the last day of the month, amortization will begin on the 1st day of the subsequent month. Mid-Month Amortization Method does not apply to prepaid expenses with a monthly amortization equal to or greater than 50,000 USD or if the amortization if spread only over 1 period. If monthly amortization is equal to or more than 50,000 USD, the first month amortization will be calculated based on actual number of days where services were rendered. Prepaid Not Paid: For any prepaid expenses not processed for payment, an adjustment for “prepaid not paid” is posted to the respective prepaid expense account and AP manual adjustment account (GL Account 2001). A prepaid expense is not treated as an asset if a liability remains in the AP sub-ledger. Prepaid not paid adjustments are performed on a quarterly basis at minimum. Any deposits paid which will be held for more than 12 months such as security deposits or deposits to retain consultants will be booked to Security & Other Deposits (GL Account 1620) Prepaid Bonuses with a Clawback will be recorded to Prepaid Bonus w/Clawback (GL Account 1152) and will be amortized in accordance with the bonus agreement terms, using the mid-month convention. Finally, the balance is reviewed one last time when the Senior Accounting Manager performs a review of the financials prior to closing the period. Team member travel expenses are expensed in the period incurred. Costs related to third party vendors such as hotels, facilities, excursions are recorded to prepaid expenses and recognized as expense at the time of the event. To provide clear guidance concerning the identification and recording of items included in GitLab’s accrued and other liability accounts. The purpose of monthly accrual processes is to allocate expenses to the proper accounting period and match expenses with related revenues. At the close of each month, accrual processes ensure that all expenses related to that month are correctly included in the company’s financial statements. Additionally, this policy establishes standards and guidelines for ensuring that GitLab accounts for monthly accruals in a manner that is compliant with management’s objectives and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This policy applies to GitLab and all subsidiaries. We require that all expenses be recorded where expense exceeds $5K USD or above, in the period the expense was incurred. The accrual process should be completed on a monthly/quarterly basis to ensure liabilities are recorded accurately in their respective periods and/or quarters. In order to meet industry standards for Month-End close deadlines the Finance and Operations teams are responsible to provide on Working Day -1 (ex. Friday July 30th = WD -1, Monday August 2nd = WD 1) the calculations, information, details and backup needed to support the accruals. The following items should be accrued monthly as necessary (note: this list is not all-inclusive): Any other material obligation not mentioned above that is a liability of GitLab Obligations that accrue over time are recorded throughout the accounting period in a methodical and rational manner. Obligations that accrue when an event occurs should be recorded at the time of the event. Factors that are considered in determining the time of recording accrued liabilities include: The Finance team is responsible for having procedures in place to reconcile accounts monthly and for keeping documentation to support accrued liabilities. Payables and accrued liabilities are recorded at face value, plus or minus any applicable adjustments. In most cases, the payable amount can be determined from the vendor bill. If not, then the amount should be verified against any relevant documents before recording the liability. When actual values are not available, the recorded value should be based on best available estimates. Estimates should be based on current market price and experience/history. The Sr. Accounting Manager is responsible for performing an overall review of accrued liabilities, one to three business days after accounts payable closes each month, to help ensure that all expenses are captured accurately. Foreign currency translation describes the method used in converting a foreign entity’s functional currency (as determined and documented in GitLab.com>Finance>Issues>#630) to the reporting entity’s financial statement currency. Prior to translating the foreign entity’s financial statements into the reporting entity’s currency, the foreign entity’s financials must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), specifically under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.52 . GitLab’s financial statement reporting currency is USD. The functional currency of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Changes in foreign currency translation are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the consolidated statement of equity and ultimately carried over to the consolidated balance sheet, under equity. Exchange rates used in the currency translation process vary across the three primary financial statement components: Transaction Risk vs Translation Risk Currency transaction risk is due to company transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions must be restated into the entity functional currency equivalents before they can be recorded. Gains(losses) are recognized when a payment is made or interim balance sheet dates. Currency translation risk occurs due to the company owning assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Cumulative Translation Adjustment A cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) is an entry to the comprehensive income section of a translated balance sheet that summarizes the gains(losses) resulting from exchange rate differences over time. Currency values shift constantly, affecting how a currency is valued against others. The CTA is a line item in the consolidated balance sheet that captures gains(losses) associated with international business activity and exposure to foreign markets. The changes in CTA are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). CTA’s are required under GAAP since they help distinguish between actual operating gains(losses) and those that arise from the currency translation process. Additional information on our reporting standards surrounding CTA’s can be found in FASB Topic 830, “Foreign Currency Matters.” Recording CTA - Exchange rate gains and losses for individual transactions are captured automatically by our ERP system, NetSuite. However, a CTA entry must be made in order to properly distinguish currency translation gains(losses) from other general gains(losses) in the consolidated financial statements. This entry includes reconciliation of any inter-company activity that generates foreign exchange gains(losses). The CTA is made on a monthly basis as part of our financial statement reporting cycle. This policy establishes GitLab’s guidelines regarding the structure, responsibilities and requirements underlying the chart of accounts (COA). This policy establishes formal responsibilities and accountabilities for how GitLab handles requests for new, modified or closed data elements on the COA. The Controller is responsible for all aspects of financial accounting and reporting, and governs the COA. All requests for new or modified (including closure/deactivation) COA segments, hierarchies, and configuration attributes are subject to approval by the Finance team. All requests for new or modified accounts must be submitted to the Accounting Manager for review and approval through a request using the Finance issue tracker. There are other stakeholders associated with the COA that may influence certain business decisions or financial system configurations. The Controller and Accounting Manager will include selected stakeholders in the related procedures and processes when and if appropriate. Potential stakeholders include, but may not be limited to: The general ledger attributes subject to this policy will be defined by the Controller based upon factors including but not limited to: Once an amendment to the COA has been approved, the Accounting Manager will ensure the necessary changes are implemented by updating and then closing the issue. The COA is maintained in NetSuite. Changes to the COA can only be made by the Controller and/or Accounting Manager. This policy applies to GitLab Inc. (“GitLab” or the “Company”) and all of its subsidiaries. To establish guidelines for assessing, preparing and reviewing balance sheet account reconciliations on a consistent basis in accordance with corporate policies and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Account reconciliations are prepared and reviewed monthly or quarterly for each active balance sheet account at the natural account level based upon the risk rating assessed (see risk rating assessment below). Account reconciliations will be prepared consolidated in USD or by entity in the respective functional currency. Each month end close the Accounting Manager assigns each balance sheet account or groups of accounts to its respective preparer and reviewer using FloQast (Account Reconciliation Tool). The assignments are set once and will roll over into the next accounting period. The Accounting Manager will make changes to assignments as needed. The preparer and reviewers can not be the same person to ensure segregation of duties. The balances from NetSuite will be auto synced into FloQast each period end so the preparers can prepare their recons based on the NetSuite ending balance for their respective assigned accounts. The preparer(s) will ensure the following: The reviewer(s) will ensure the following: FloQast will auto sign-off the recon on our behalf if the following is met: If the balance changes after review, approval or auto sign-off the recon will be automatically unreconciled by FloQast and the preparer and reviewers will need to follow the above steps again. Once a year in the beginning of Q4, the Controller and/or CFO will review each active balance sheet account and rate it from High, Medium and Low. The risk level of each account is evaluated based both on the quantitative value (to determine materiality) and the qualitative factors listed below: High Risk Accounts will be reconciled by the preparer monthly (for the exception of tax and equity related accounts which will be reconciled quarterly) and will require 1st level review by an accounting manager or above and 2nd level review by the CFO or PAO. Medium Risk Accounts will be reconciled by the preparer monthly and will require 1st level review by an accounting manager or above. Low Risk Accounts will be reconciled by the preparer monthly or quarterly and will require 1st level review by an accounting manager or above. If there is no activity and/or the account balance is zero the reconciliation will be auto certified by BlackLine. Once each reconciliation is reviewed/approved the account reconciliation is locked in BlackLine and no further changes can be made for that period. Once the period is officially closed the Senior Accounting Manager will ensure all recons are in approved, reviewed or in a auto-certified status before moving into the next period."

    "paragraph": "GitLab’s Global Travel & Expense Policy is meant to provide guidance to all Team Members to ensure that we act in the best interest of our Company at all times. The purpose of this policy is to: Managers and/or Budget Owners : Following expenses are categorized for reimbursement purposes with specific policy definition attached to it. The limits below are in USD, please use local currency equivalents when considering other currencies. All business related flights need to be booked through Navan, and will be paid by GitLab travel card. For each flight search, Navan determines the price in real time. Also to note that while it is sometimes possible to find a cheaper flight outside of Navan, we get overall better rates in the aggregate with the buying power of the whole company. Even if a flight is cheaper outside of Navan, please book in Navan. Also submit a request under the Expenses -> Travel Related Expenses page of HelpLab with screenshots of Navan’s rate and the other airlines rate so the Expense team can address with Navan. The airfare policy in Navan is set up as a “Dynamic Policy” which calculates a fair market price for every search based on travel dates and destinations. Any purchases that are over 20% of the Dynamic Policy will be flagged for further review by your manager. Also note that anything booked outside of Navan will flag as “Out of Policy”, and will need to be reviewed by your manager and the AP team. Expense Type / Navan Policy Category: Airfare Purchase the liability insurance that is excess of the standard inclusion of State minimum coverage in the rental agreement at the rental agency. GitLab’s insurance policy provides liability insurance for rental cars while conducting company business, but it may be excess over any underlying liability coverage through the driver or credit card company used to purchase the rental. Purchase the liability offered at the rental counter if there are Non-US Team Members renting autos in the US or Canada. While workers’ compensation would protect an injured US Team Member, other passengers may have the right to sue. To ensure that GitLab has protection when a Non-US Team Member invites another person into the car we recommend the purchase of this insurance when offered at the rental counter. B. Physical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver Do Not purchase the Collision Damage Waiver offered at the rental counter. GitLab purchases coverage for damage to rented vehicles. If travel to Mexico is required, purchase the liability insurance for Mexico offered at the rental counter. You should verify that the rental agreement clearly states that the vehicle may be driven into Mexico and liability coverage will apply. Countries other than the US and Canada: In the event of an accident resulting in damage to the rental car, the Non-US rental agency will charge the credit card used to make the reservation with an estimated amount of repair costs if insurance is not purchased. If this happens, GitLab does not purchase Foreign Corporate Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage to reimburse for damages. Expense Type / Navan Policy Category: Rental cars Expense Type / Navan Policy Category: Lodging Expense Type / Navan Policy Category: Traveling: meals for myself Expense Type / Navan Policy Category: Traveling: Team Events and meals Expense Type / Navan Policy Category: Distance Driven Expense Type / Navan Policy Category: Train travel Expense Type / Navan Policy Category: Public transport, tolls & parking The company will cover all work-related travel expenses.

    "title": "Financial Planning & Analysis",
    "paragraph": "Maximize GitLab’s long-term valuation by enabling e-group and FP&A to plan, prioritize, and execute effectively FP&A comprises five different sub-teams to support our FP&A goals: Key planning milestones are listed below. For a more detailed timeline and planning checklist please engage your FP&A business partner. The LRO is refreshed on an annual basis, occurring shortly after the fiscal year plan is finalized. After the LRO is refreshed, there may be additional updates throughout the remainder of the year, on a quarterly and ad-hoc basis to determine whether near-term priorities and funding are needed in order to achieve long-term goals and financial targets. As part of the quarterly and ad-hoc updates to LRO, the following are included: The following are inputs in the LRO refresh and subsequent LRO updates: The Corporate Finance team leads the LRO refresh and updates in collaboration with: e-group members to determine key investments, capabilities, and dependencies; GTM Finance team for sales productivity/capacity models, CTB, and bookings attainment; G&A Finance team for total rewards strategy, benefit assumptions; and the R&D Finance team to help inform on allocations, hosting/infrastructure expenses. For GitLab’s top growth drivers and new products, drive and document alignment between contributors to success. Writing a business plan drives clarity of thought and operations. Agree on governance models to manage initiative success and cross-functional accountability. At a minimum, each business plan should cover: GitLab’s FP&A team participates in a rigorous monthly close process. These dates are based on an 8-day accounting close. Corporate FP&A will confirm the close date with the accounting team and update the FP&A Close calendar in Google accordingly. For FY23, the target is to close by WD 5 with full consolidation (including tax entries, eliminations) by WD 10. The Accounting close calendar can be found here . Each month after the financials have been published, GitLab reviews all aspects of the business including Corporate Metrics, Bookings, Revenue, Gross Margins, Expenses. The goal of this meeting is to do a comprehensive review so that finance leadership has a pulse on the business and signs off on the financials. Based on insights from variance analysis, the FP&A team makes actionable recommendations to the CFO and e-group to ensure continued performance to Plan/Forecast. The variance analysis will compare department budgets with actual results and examine any material differences between budgeted and actual costs. Additionally, the actuals for expenses will be compared to the quarterly rolling forecast. The expenses are reviewed at the divisional department level, allowing GitLab to measure progress in meeting its Plan or rolling forecast. The team also evaluates the accuracy of forecasts and will make adjustments to the next rolling forecast. The study of differences between actuals and the Plan or Forecast. During the variance analysis processes the GitLab FP&A team analyzes and isolates any variance in question to the lowest level possible. The team reviews detailed items in order to identify the root cause of the variance. This could include transaction date, cost center, vendor, location, department or additional low level details. The FP&A team takes the following into consideration while evaluating variances in relation to materiality thresholds: The FP&A team delivers an FP&A expense flux review document at each monthly close, documenting and quantifying business drivers for variance. The goal is two-fold: We measure our team performance based on our forecast accuracy, also known as variance percentage. Variance percentage is defined as the difference between actuals and Plan or rolling forecast. We calculate it as follows: Variance analysis should address any inputs or additional requests from the last Variance meeting , as applicable. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) does not provide definitive guidance in distinguishing material information from immaterial information. Therefore, GitLab uses a percentage based approach for defining materiality thresholds and can be found below. The Plan vs Actuals vs Forecast Sisense dashboard provides the data for the threshold analysis via a color coded legend. Our goal is to have revenue and EBIT variance percentage within +/- 2% on a quarterly basis. Key accounts and expenses by division should be within +/- 2% versus Plan or rolling quarterly forecast every quarter. EVPs are held accountable to meet the budget in dollars that they are given. The budgets typically are broken into headcount and program spend. Each finance business partner will run a meeting with their Finance leader and the EVP to review the past month. The information should be presented as timely as possible. Given the accounting close is 8 days, the team is asked to use pre-close numbers for the review to increase the speed of information. During the meeting, the Finance Business Partners will review GitLab results in addition to a detailed overview. Each division can expect to review the following during the monthly meetings: Following the month-end close, the Finance Business Partners will create a variance deck and distribute department income statements to the related budget owners and the e-group members. Each department is then responsible for comparing these reports, which contain actual costs, to the budget. Departments, with guidance from the Finance Business Partners, should analyze their data and if necessary, discuss items of interest and take appropriate action. Any questions regarding the cost data should be discussed with the Finance Business Partner. The close timeline for each quarter follows the timeline above for monthly close and includes additional key dates and processes: As a public company we share financial results publicly after the close of each fiscal quarter or fiscal year. The purpose, timeline, and deliverables can be found on our Investor Relations page here . Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) team is the owner of SSOT for GitLab’s Hiring Plan which contributes to our Headcount Forecast. Headcount Forecast is a live forecast in Workday Adaptive (a financial planning software) Hiring Plan is maintained by the Finance Business Partners (FBPs) and shared with Talent Acquisition (TA) team and Business Partners (BPs) Finance owns the Hiring Plan to ensure there is only one Headcount Forecast and Hiring Plan for the business Hiring Plan increases our predictability as a company and streamlines the hiring process Based on historical time to start data, new requisitions released via RLOA in a quarter can be expected to start in the following quarter at the earliest For questions specific to TA’s process and REQ creation, please refer to TA’s section of the handbook Position ID is a unique identifier and is the link between approved headcount and the Hiring Plan FP&A and TA discussed and agreed upon the above process. This SSOT process ensures consistency in Hiring Plan execution Planned Positions include all Net New positions to existing GitLab active employees. Backfill Positions include all positions created due to departure or termination of an existing employee. Both PID and GHPID are created and maintained by FP&A team as unique identifiers in Hiring Plan All PIDs are created by the Corporate FP&A team and are tied to Headcount Forecast (including Hiring Plan) FP&A Position IDs increase visibility and accuracy for headcount forecasting (count and dollars) and simplify & provide transparency on modeled headcount (attrition and backfill). All GHPIDs are system-generated by a FP&A internal Google Sheet FP&A team is the owner and maintainer of SSOT for GitLab’s Hiring Plan The FP&A team and Talent Acquisition Managers collaborate to ensure understanding and implementation of the most up-to-date view of forecasted headcount-related expenses. This interlock enables GitLab to respond quickly and make live decisions through a weekly P&L forecast and the rolling list of asks (RLOA) process . This process also ensures alignment and accuracy of headcount forecasts when FP&A locks its annual plan and monthly rolling forecasts. This process also tracks company metrics against Wall Street expectations related to non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Please see the Headcount Metrics and Processes page for definitions and key metrics. The Hiring Plan data is divided into four headcount forecast templates, one for each cost center with Cost of Goods Sold allocated among Sales and R&D. The data and analysis from the four templates roll into the Summary file. The four templates can be found in the Headcount Live Summary Dashboard . Unless otherwise noted in the HC Forecast calendar or communicated via Slack, the interlock process occurs weekly as follows: By noon (PST) Monday , the Corp FP&A team downloads the data from Adaptive and refreshes the headcount forecast templates. Talent Acquisition also refreshes the headcount forecast templates with the latest data from Greenhouse. By end of day (PST) Wednesday , the Talent Acquisition Managers and Recruiters review their respective roles line by line and make adjustments and comments related to expected start dates and other role details provided by the Finance Business Partners. If no indication is made for a specific role in the headcount forecast template, Talent Acquisition signals that the current indication is reasonable and indicative of a 50/50 “most-realistic” forecast. The Talent Acquisition Managers also pay close attention to any recruiting capacity restraints within any given quarter. In order to maximize transparency and understanding of any changes, the Talent Acquisition Managers and Recruiters provide comments (e.g., wrong GHP ID, rejection of an offer, delay due to business decision, etc.) for specific roles. By end of day (PST) Thursday , the Finance Business Partners update Adaptive with their best estimates of the start dates of all planned personnel for the forecast period based on the input from Talent Acquisition in the headcount forecast templates. This reflects a 50/50 “most realistic” view of headcount expenses/timing. By end of day (PST) Friday , the Corp FP&A team sends a P&L snapshot to the CFO incorporating any headcount forecast adjustments. Note: P&L snapshots are not provided during accounting close. Communication related to the interlock takes place in the #fpa-ta_headcount_forecast Slack channel. All parties involved in the interlock are also granted access to the “HC Forecast” Google Calendar. The Finance Business Partners and Talent Acquisition Managers collaborate to provide the most current and 50/50 “most-realistic” view of headcount-related expenses. This is done through the interlock process in the headcount forecast template and is ultimately uploaded into the Planned Personnel sheet in Adaptive. The inputs loaded into Adaptive are then used to provide the CFO a weekly P&L snapshot in order to facilitate in-quarter spending decisions and ensure the company tracks vs. guidance and consensus expectations. The primary mechanism to ensure efficient spend of company assets is the Procure to Pay process, and specifically completion of the vendor and contract approval workflow prior to authorization. The procurement team or your finance business partner can assist with questions related to this process. The second mechanism is the budget vs actual review to determine reasons for variances vs plan. See the section on Variance Meeting with CFO and Variance Analysis . A manual on how to update and maintain Adaptive integration can be found here . This document is maintained by the Corporate FP&A team. Throughout quarter, FP&A maintains alignment with business needs. During quarterly RLOA process, FP&A team finalizes RLOA proposal to share with e-group, and communicates decisions to functional leaders to enable business execution. Below is the timeline Note: WD is defined as Working Days, which are Mondays through Fridays, excluding Federal holidays."

    "paragraph": "The Procurement team manages GitLab’s Supplier Lifecycle through the process of strategically vetting and selecting vendors, negotiating commercial terms, the purchasing of goods and services, and managing the renewal or vendor offboarding process. Division alignment for spend over >$25k USD / year: Procurement is a cross-functional team that supports GitLab as a public company. We have four key objectives monitored in the following ways: The Procurement team is responsible for ensuring there is a process for suppliers to be managed throughout their lifecycle of doing business with GitLab from initial selection and contracting to recurring reviews and renewals to cancellation. All new spend, changing of vendors for existing services, and market reviews every 3 years for existing contracts should follow the RFP and Vendor Selection process , unless approved by your Procurement Category Manager, to ensure we are choosing the best partner for GitLab with the best commercial terms. This must be done prior to verbally agreeing to terms or contracting with any new or existing vendor. Before sharing details and/or confidential information regarding GitLab business needs, obtain a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement from the potential vendor(s). Refer to the Signature Authorization Matrix for signing authority. All vendors must adhere to the GitLab Partner Code of Ethics . It is mandatory all vendors contractually adhere to this if they would like to do business with us. (Note these are typically not required in event related agreements unless the vendor is providing services). Depending on the amount of spend, Procurement will assist or lead in negotiating the pricing and commercial terms of the contract. Depending on the types of data shared with the vendor, Privacy and Security will need to complete a review of the vendor. Depending on nature of vendor’s services and/or whether the vendor has been recommended to us, the Ethics and Compliance team will need to complete an anticorruption/antibribery review and, potentially, recommend additional measures to mitigate that risk. For more information on these requirements and steps, see the Review Steps, Timeline, and Considerations section All work that is done with a vendor must have a completed contract to be compliant and work may not be started until a contract is in place. Contracts include NDAs , Master Service Agreements and Statements of Works. Our legal team assists with this step in the process. Please see the legal review process for more details. Additionally, please note that a small number of team members can sign agreements on behalf of GitLab - please see the Authorization Matrix for more details. In order for vendors to be paid, they need to complete their onboarding in our systems. Please see the New Vendor Onboarding section for more details. Procurement will work with you through the Quarterly Procurement & Business Spotlights to review upcoming renewals and cancellations, new spend projects, and identifying vendor’s segmentation tier: Strategic, Niche, Commodity, or Transactional. Identifying the Segmentation Tier your supplier(s) falls within helps determine the right vendor management approach, e.g. renew the contract, RFP, business reviews on a recurring cadence, continuous improvement plans, etc. If holding a business review with a vendor, the following topics should be discussed: On a quarterly basis, the Procurement team will meet with business stakeholders in each department to review a rolling 12 month list of renewals, focusing on the upcoming 2 quarters. This list is pulled from Zip and Coupa. The list should be reviewed and prioritized with the business owners. The renewal process should start at least 90 days ahead of the renewal date providing ample time to review the terms and decide: The following methods will be used to capture cancellations (which include terminations and/or non-renewals): For each of the above, if a cancellation is desired (which include terminations and/or non-renewals) please follow the “Cancellation Process” outlined below: Upcoming terminations/non-renewals should be discussed with Procurement during the Quarterly Category Spotlight meetings that Procurement holds with category leads/budget owners. As Procurement is made aware of upcoming cancellations during these meetings, Procurement will review on a quarterly basis any known cancellations with Legal to ensure notification requirements are met. Procurement and Legal will then work with the business owner on completing the above process. If a cancellation is determined outside of this quarterly cadence, notify your Procurement Category Manager and complete the above process as soon as possible. Anytime a group of suppliers are being evaluated for services/goods or a purchase is being made on behalf of GitLab that does not qualify as a personal expense or meet the list of exceptions , Procurement must be engaged BEFORE a purchase and/or work can begin. Start the Procurement Process Majority of the Procurement Process lives within our Procurement system called Zip. You can access Zip via your Okta home page , or if you need Zip access, submit an access request here . For more Zip training materials, review the Zip End Users Guide and the Tips for Submitting a Zip Request page . Depending on a few factors of your purchase, there are different ways to engage Procurement and start the Procurement process: If you’re hiring a contingent worker, please read GitLab’s Contingent Worker Policy , which provides comprehensive guidelines on engaging with different types of contingent workers. The policy outlines three main categories: Staff Augmentation Workers (agency-provided temporary resources), Consultancy Services (third-party professional services), and Independent Contractors (used by exception only). You’ll find detailed information about each worker type’s characteristics, duration limits, country hiring guidelines, contractor extension processes, and background screening requirements. This policy is designed to help team members understand when and how to properly engage contingent workers while mitigating classification risks. Note: For subcontractors for the Professional Services team, please use the process for Revenue Partner Payments. Requests can take 5 days to 3+ weeks for processing depending on a number of factors that will impact the time for review of a Purchase Request including, but not limited to: Each review’s targeted approval time is outlined below, but as mentioned above, this is dependent on many factors and the accuracy and completeness of information provided by the requester. If your request meets any of the additional approval criterias outlined below, please plan accordingly and submit your Zip request allowing each cross-functional team enough time to complete their review. Please follow the steps outlined for urgent requests that cannot meet the below timeline and have specific and quantifiable impact to the business. The amount of time for review and reaching execution is based on the details below. Use these SLAs as guidelines, noting that each contract review is unique. If additional terms, requirements, and/or risks are identified, the timeline may be extended. The ability for GitLab to work efficiently through an agreement negotiation relies on the vendor and their counsel responding promptly to GitLab redlines and comments. Delays from the supplier will delay approval. Types of Vendors and Review Times Existing vendors for renewals or upsells: 3-5 days Negotiation, Security, Privacy, and PeopleOps reviews are only required if the purchase request meets certain criteria, as described below. In the event two or more of these activities are required, they will happen in parallel to one another and Legal’s review. If you are unable to plan and have a legitimate reason to escalate a purchase request, follow the process below. Exceptions to the PO Policy are: The procurement team from a compliance and risk perspective has developed a process to handle third party risk to reduce the risk of the following: When any of the following is met: Any time GitLab engages with a third party for the procurement of goods and/or services, which require GitLab to engage in a contract, the GitLab Legal Procurement team will review the terms and conditions. The purpose of this team is to review the contract which GitLab will enter into, and ensure the following: In addition to ensuring terms and conditions, the GitLab Legal Procurement team collaborates frequently with procurement and business stakeholders to ensure any (and all) contracts align with the needs of the team. The GitLab Legal Procurement team addresses the needs of stakeholders ranging from complex technical application and platform services, to creating and drafting event contracts to meet the needs of GitLab events. As GitLab does with its own customers, agreements with third parties include obligations that vendors have to GitLab. These can include, but are not limited to: For any large internal events with a total cost greater than $1M, such as SKO, President’s Club, Commit, etc, the following should be completed before any contracts are executed or any work is conducted. The planning stages for events of this size should be completed at least 18-24 months prior to the actual event. This allows for ample time to get the necessary internal approvals, run any RFPs needed, and book large hotel blocks or buyouts."

    "paragraph": "The Tax Team is responsible for GitLab’s tax compliance (see here for payroll taxes), tax planning and accounting for business taxes, including income taxes and indirect taxes such as sales taxes and value-added taxes (VAT). Taxation differs between countries, and taxation in one country is not always complementary to taxation in another country, resulting in possible double-taxation on the same GitLab revenue. It is the fundamental goal of the Tax Team to minimize double taxation, to optimize our global effective tax rate, and to timely apply resources to various company needs. Those needs range from routine compliance and tax audits to strategically positioning the company for its next phase of growth. The Tax team is part of the Finance function and headed by the VP Tax.

The Tax team is structured to address (a) U.S. domestic taxes and global accounting for business taxes and (b) international tax planning and compliance, including US international tax planning. This page has been moved to the internal handbook website due to safety/privacy: https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/tax/ An Indirect Tax Identification Number (“Indirect Tax ID” or “Tax ID”) is a unique identification number assigned by tax authorities to businesses registered for Value Added Tax (VAT), Goods and Services Tax (GST), or similar indirect taxes. This number identifies your business as a registered taxpayer eligible to charge and collect indirect taxes. GitLab is required to comply with local tax regulations in various jurisdictions. When you provide a valid Indirect Tax ID: Without a valid Indirect Tax ID, GitLab may be required to charge applicable VAT/GST rates based on your location. If your business is not registered for indirect taxes (due to size thresholds or other reasons), you may not have an Indirect Tax ID. In such cases, GitLab will charge the applicable VAT/GST rate according to local regulations. Important Disclaimer: The formats listed below are samples of commonly used indirect tax ID formats and are provided solely as a reference to assist customers. GitLab does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this information and assumes no responsibility to update or revise this information.

The Staff EBA to the CEO shall ensure that there are separate calendar invites for all attendees within each session, all including exact session start and end times, the appropriate Zoom link, and links to the agenda document. Any supplemental materials are required to be linked in the agenda document for each session. This is the outline of a past agenda, but we adapt agenda based on what is important to discuss: This section is updated after every Board Meeting by the Staff EBA to the CFO for the next Board Meeting. GitLab uses Nasdaq’s Boardvantage (NBV) portal for the electronic dissemination and storage of materials relating to GitLab’s Board Meetings. For a more detailed overview of navigating the NBV portal, please click here to view the Internal Reference Guide . We usually have a Board Dinner on the evening before a Board Meeting. The EBA to the CEO is responsible for coordinating this dinner. Board Members, Local E-Group members, and the CoS to the CEO are all optional attendees. Bios for attendees of the Board Dinner should be sent by the EBA to the CEO 3 business days in advance of the Board Dinner. Each quarter, E-Group can choose to invite an additional team member as a Key Talent Guest. If this is desired in a specific quarter, at least a month before the dinner, the CoS to the CEO will gather nominations and ensure that E-Group has identified an invitee. Criteria for consideration includes: Once the Key Talent Guest has been identified, it is the relevant E-Group team member’s responsibility to ensure that managers of this person are aware of the invite. The EBA to the CEO will then confirm that the guest is able to join. If not, the invite will go to the runner up. Once a Key Talent Guest is confirmed, the EBA to the CEO should enter their name in the Key Talent Board Dinner Guests . GitLab will cover this person’s travel expenses. A person’s location will not be considered in the selection criteria though the person’s travel must be allowed under GitLab’s travel policies and guidelines .

    "title": "GitLab the Product",
    "paragraph": "Principles - Processes - Categories - GitLab the Product - Being a PM - Leadership We believe that a single application for the DevOps lifecycle based on convention over configuration offers a superior user experience. The advantage can be quoted from the Wikipedia page for convention over configuration: “decrease the number of decisions that developers need to make, gaining simplicity, and not necessarily losing flexibility”. In GitLab you only have to specify unconventional aspects of your workflow. The happy path is frictionless from planning to monitoring . We’re doubling down on our product for concurrent DevOps which brings the entire lifecycle into one application and lets everyone contribute. We are leaning into what our customers have told us they love: our single application strategy, our pace of iteration, and our deep focus on users. Consider opportunities to take advantage of this unique attribute in early iterations. Integrating features with different parts of the application can increase the adoption of early iterations. Other advantages: Although not every feature needs to be integrated with other parts of the application, you should consider if there are unique or powerful benefits for integrating the feature more deeply in the second or third iteration. GitLab.com runs GitLab Enterprise Edition. To keep our code easy to maintain and to make sure everyone reaps the benefits of all our efforts, we will not separate GitLab.com codebase from the Enterprise Edition codebase. To avoid complexity, GitLab.com tiers and GitLab self-managed tiers are named the same. GitLab.com subscriptions work on a namespace basis, which can mean: This means that group-level features are only available on the group namespace. Public projects get Ultimate for free. Public groups do not get Ultimate for free. Because: Admittedly, this is complex and can be confusing for product managers when implementing features. Ideas to simplify this are welcome (but note that making personal namespaces equal to groups is not one of them, as that introduces other issues). For more guidance on feature tiers and pricing, visit tiering guidance for features See the terminology of deprecations . By definition, a removal is a breaking change. With a few exceptions , if the answer is yes to any of the following questions, the change is to be considered a breaking change and should be avoided other than for critical business risk. For special definitions of what constitutes a breaking change for our APIs, see: For Experiment or Beta features, please see Support for experiment, beta, and generally available features . Introducing a breaking change in a minor release is against policy because it can disrupt our customers, however there are some rare exceptions: In all cases, the PM or EM must follow the Request a Breaking Change process . Deprecating and removing a feature needs to follow a specific process because it is important that we minimize disruption for our users. As you move through the process, use the language deprecated or removed to specify the current state of the feature that is going to be or has been removed. Please follow the process outlined in the docs . We deploy changes to GitLab.com many times a day. Because they are part of a continuous delivery process, these changes, including breaking changes, are not as predictable for customers. Starting from GitLab 17.0, we introduced fixed windows during which breaking changes are rolled out to GitLab.com. The fixed windows are set as the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the three weeks preceding the major release date, typically following the X.11 release date. A detailed example of what this looks like can be found in our 17.0 introduction issue . Breaking changes should only be enabled during the breaking change windows. This means that where breaking changes are behind feature flags, the changes (feature flag) should only be switched during one of these windows to ensure customers workflows are not impacted outside of these communicated periods. Product Managers will be responsible for making sure that as part of the deprecations and removals process, where applicable the deprecation/removal is aligned with a publicly communicated Breaking Change Window. In June of 2023, we changed the process so that all deprecations and removals are displayed on the Deprecations page . The announcements are grouped by the milestone they will be removed in. The deprecation announcement date is listed below each individual item. Our CI syntax keeps evolving. We cannot support all keywords indefinitely, so deprecating and removing keywords is inevitable. GitLab does not have a versioning system for CI/CD configuration. Therefore, it is critical to over-communicate our deprecation purposes to our users and take the necessary precautions to reduce the impact on their projects. Deprecating a keyword is risky because it will break all pipelines using it, and in some cases, users are not aware of the keyword they use in their pipeline. The deprecation process described below is similar to the deprecating and removing features process, with additional steps to reduce the risks which involved with removing a CI/CD keyword. Deprecation notice - Syntax removal introduces a breaking change, as outlined in our deprecation process, we must notify the community and customers, which means including a deprecation notice in the monthly release post. Track keyword usage - Tracking keyword usage should begin as early as possible. It is a mandatory step that helps estimate the user impact, timing, and needed effort. The more users use the keyword, the more time it takes to remove it (It took more than four years to move from remove to deprecation for ’type’ keyword). In-app warning - Provide our users with an in-app notification that we plan to remove a keyword they use in their pipeline. Our customers will get a notification in each run of the pipeline that uses the deprecated keyword. The warning will be printed: This step is optional if the keyword usage is relatively low (Recommend minimal reach of ~5% impacted users). Keyword removal - The keyword will be removed from our code and schema and should happen in a major version. Once removed, using the keyword will result in a lint error. Naming new features or renaming existing features is notoriously hard and sensitive to many opinions. The bar for renaming existing features is extremely high, especially for long-time features with a lot of usage. Some valid but not exclusive reasons are: When renaming features follow the process to rename a category starting with an MR to change the name in data/features.yml . Request review by the Product Director and Engineering Director of your Section for approval. Optionally, add a comment including your technical writer, engineering manager, product design manager, and product designer for transparency. When renaming a feature other items to consider are updates to documentation, blogs, direction pages and competitive information. What’s New is a feature that is part of GitLab.com and Self-managed GitLab that is used to communicate highlights from each release. After each major release, a yaml file is published that contains 3-10 highlights from the release along with links to the relevant documentation to get started using them. A small notification dot appears above the “?” icon, and when users click on “What’s new” in the menu, a drawer containing the updates slides into view. The goal of What’s New is to make it easy for users to be aware of the most important changes in GitLab so we can help them stay up-to-date on all of our changes and feature updates. Use this section as guidance for using existing features and developing new ones. To keep the permissions system clear and consistent we should improve our roles to match common flows instead of introducing more and more permission configurations on each resource, if at all possible. For big instances with many users, having one role for creating projects, doing code review and managing teams may be insufficient. So, in the long term, we want our permission system to explicitly cover the next roles: All the above can be achieved by iteratively improving existing roles. You can now find our security paradigm on the Secure Strategy page. Also see our Secure Team engineering handbook . Traditionally, applications only reveal valuable information about usage and performance to administrators. However, most GitLab instances only have a handful of admins and they might not sign in very often. This means interesting data is rarely seen, even though it can help to motivate teams to learn from other teams, identify issues or simply make people in the organisation aware of adoption. To this end, performance data and usage statistics should be available to all users by default. It’s equally important that this can be optionally restricted to admins-only, as laws in some countries require this, such as Germany. GitLab is developed in English, but supports the contribution of other languages. GitLab will always default to English. We will not infer the language / location / nationality of the user and change the language based on that. You can’t safely infer user preferences from their system settings either. Technical users are used to this, usually writing software in English, even though their language in the office is different. Fast applications are better applications. Everything from the core user experience, to building integrations and using the API is better if every query is quick, and every page loads fast. When you’re building new features, performance has to be top of mind. We must strive to make every single page fast. That means it’s not acceptable for new pages to add to performance debt. When they ship, they should be fast. You must account for all cases, from someone with a single object, to thousands of objects. Read the handbook page relating to performance of GitLab.com , and note the Speed Index target shown there (read it thoroughly if you need a detailed overview of performance). Then: You must prioritize improvements according to their impact (per the availability & performance priority labels ). Pages that are visited often should be prioritized over pages that rarely have any visitors. However, if page load time approaches 4 seconds or more, they are considered no longer usable and should be fixed at the earliest opportunity. In addition, to meet the ethical criteria of GNU , all our JavaScript code on GitLab.com has to be free as in freedom. Read more about this on GNU’s website . The ability to monitor, visualize and improve upon cycle time (or: time to value) is fundamental to GitLab’s product. A shorter cycle time will allow you to: When we’re adding new capabilities to GitLab, we tend to focus on things that will reduce the cycle time for our customers. This is why we choose convention over configuration and why we focus on automating the entire software development lifecycle. All friction of setting up a new project and building the pipeline of tools you need to ship any kind of software should disappear when using GitLab. We understand that not everyone will use GitLab for everything all the time, especially when first adopting GitLab. We want you to use more of GitLab because you love that part of GitLab. GitLab plays well with others, even when you use only one part of GitLab it should be a great experience. GitLab ships with built-in integrations to many popular applications. We aspire to have the world’s best integrations for Slack, JIRA, and Jenkins. Many other applications integrate with GitLab , and we are open to adding new integrations to our technology partners page . New integrations with GitLab can vary in richness and complexity; from a simple webhook, and all the way to a Project Service . GitLab welcomes and supports new integrations to be created to extend collaborations with other products. GitLab plays well with others by providing APIs for nearly anything you can do within GitLab. GitLab can be a provider of authentication for external applications. There is some natural tension between GitLab being a single-application for the entire DevOps lifecycle, and our support for better user experience via integration with existing DevOps tools. We’ll prioritize first our efforts to improve the single-application experience, second to enable a rich ecosystem of partners, and third to improve integration with the broader ecosystem to other tools. GitLab is open-source so this should not prohibit contributors adding integrations for anything that they are missing - as long as it fits with GitLab product vision. If you don’t have time to contribute and are a customer we’ll gladly work with you to design the API addition or integration you need."

    "title": "GitLab Product Management",
    "paragraph": "This document describes what Product Management does, where, when, and how to engage with the product management team. At GitLab, the PMs lead their specialization. That is, the Create PM decides what the Create group works on, for which release, and makes sure this furthers our goals. This includes bugs, features, and architectural changes. The PM can’t be expected to parse every single bug or issue that comes by, so they have to rely heavily on the input of the various stakeholders. To be able to achieve this, both the PM and the stakeholders have to actively work together. It’s a two-way street. In general terms, if you require something to happen with the product or if you need engineering staff for a particular change, you approach a PM. Preferably through creating an issue (the GitLab way), and mentioning them there. In the same vein, PMs are required to ask for feedback from the stakeholder on particular changes. If a change will affect GitLab.com and its maintenance, a PM should proactively reach out to infrastructure engineers to help with the scope, design, and decisions regarding this change. It is then up to the PM to weigh all these inputs and decide on a prioritization. It is to be expected that they are the best equipped to make this prioritization, while also keeping in mind all goals of GitLab. Please see the Product Categories to know which product manager handles which category. Generally speaking, all product feedback should be provided via issues. For detailed overview of how to create an issue, please read this section on the process . If you have any product-related questions, comments, input, or otherwise, the Product Manager is the primary person you should talk to, if creating an issue does not suffice . Creating an issue includes, but is not limited to, features, bugs, and other changes that need to be prioritized, changed, discussed, or need more attention. Product Managers will reach out to stakeholders when making or communicating any decision. The pressure of balancing priorities while ensuring we build excellent software is on the product managers and they need all the input they can get to achieve this. Paid features fall under their respective PMs, not under one PM in particular. For instance, Service Desk falls under the Plan PM . All feedback must follow the GitLab Community Code of Conduct . Failure to do so will result in the issues or comment being deleted. If a customer has a feature request that doesn’t already exist, refer to the process to create an issue in the gitlab-org issue tracker and choose the Feature Proposal template, following the instructions and providing as much information as possible. Once you’ve created the issue, make sure to add the appropriate labels for the product stage and/or group (e.g ~\"devops::plan\" ) if known and add a comment tagging the appropriate Product Manager. If an issue already exists, make a comment on the issue with their information and use case. Whenever you’re sharing feedback on an issue (e.g. “Customer X wants this”), please make sure to do the following: If a customer expresses interest by simply mentioning an issue number or e.g. “an integration with X”, that is not sufficient information. Before creating or commenting on an issue, make sure to ask them: The Product Manager is responsible for figuring all of this out, but being one step ahead of them will speed things up. If a customer is a member of our Product Customer Advisory Board , the CSM should add two labels: ~CAB Takeaway and ~CAB Takeaway Qx FY20xx to the issue. It is highly recommended to use the feedback template below to make this easier. You can copy/paste this to make sure you don’t miss anything or create a comment template for reusability: The ~customer priority::* labels are inputs for the prioritization model powering the customer issue prioritization framework dashboard: These dashboards represent the relative importance of a given issue to the specific customer. 1 is the lowest priority and 10 is the highest. These can be updated at any point in time and will be reflected in the model within 24 hours. You can find more context about priority labels on the customer issues prioritization framework handbook page . A customer with more than 1000 users mentioned they are interested in this feature to be able to do their sprint planning more effectively. The problem they are trying to solve is that with the current implementation, they can’t X and need to do so because Y. They are using software X to do this today, but would be able to move to GitLab if we would do this. @productmanager this issue doesn’t have a milestone right now, are we planning to address this in the near term? Customers that are assigned a Customer Success Manager typically have a collaboration project on GitLab.com, which is used to share information, document customer details, and track issues in a place that both the GitLab team and the customer’s team can access. Generally, CSMs maintain a main issue and/or enable the CS-Tool - TAM issue tracker , which lists out all feature requests the customer is interested in with links to the public GitLab issue. When a customer expresses interest in a feature, the CSM should capture that in the public GitLab issue, as well as add it as an entry in the main feature tracking issue of the customer’s collaboration project . The feature tracking issue should be maintained regularly by updating priority (elaborated on below) and milestones as the single source of truth on customer product needs. It can also be used for reviewing metrics of previously delivered feature requests. If there is a lot of discussion with the customer about a specific feature request, create an issue on the customer collaboration project about it and list that issue as a related issue on the main GitLab issue. This is another signal of the main product issue of customer interest and also allows discussion with the customer and internal GitLab team members about their needs and concerns. If you have followed the process of creating/commenting on issues and have not gotten traction, confirm that all of the necessary information is included in the issue . Follow up with the Product Manager again in the issue and in the product stage Slack channel (linking to the issue) to get additional attention and team member involvement. If a customer has identified an issue that is high priority for them, such as a work-stoppage bug or a feature required for the customer to meet a deadline, follow the expected steps for logging and tracking customer feature requests above by adding the customer’s interest in a GitLab issue and including it in the collaboration project issue. In addition, reach out to the Product Manager who is responsible for the corresponding group and discuss it with them directly. A general idea of high priority is that the customer needs a particular feature as soon as possible. Critical Priority Requests are extremely rare, but, when they occur, they are agreed upon by both Product and Engineering, with the CSM facilitating the request. If a customer is unable to continue using GitLab without a specific feature, the CSM should begin the triaging the account , follow the process to indicate customer interest in the issue, then set up regular check-ins with the Product and Engineering teams to assess the status of the feature, expectations, and potential secondary plans. For the product & engineering process, please refer to the details of a critical customer merge request . The following part of this UX design article sums it up well: Listening to the right customers at the right time is a great first start, but you also need to make sure you are interpreting their feedback/requests correctly. The reason for that is generally customers ask for something to be better, not different — they interpret their problems through existing solutions . A customer is unlikely to tell you what new product to create (that’s your company’s job!) but they will tell you what problem that product needs to solve. To do this you need to get to the underlying why behind the feature request — what is the basic problem to be solved, and then think about how to solve that problem in a fundamentally better (e.g., 10x faster, easier, cheaper) way. This concept is best described by the (most likely misattributed) quote by the founder of the Ford Motor Company, Henry Ford: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” When the customer asks for a faster horse, you should then ask why. You would invariably hear things like: I’d like to shorten my commute from home to work I’d like to be able to sell my widgets to more cities I’d like to win the Kentucky Derby Now that you understand the basic problem to be solved (of which there are many solutions including a faster horse), its your job to think of a fundamentally better way to solve it — e.g., what does a 10x faster horse look like? And one potential solution to that is obviously a car. If you hear a feature request from a customer, and they do not have a CSM assigned to their account, you should follow the normal procedure: create an issue and label it correctly. Let’s say the customer requests an enhancement to Issues. You know by reading above that you’ll have to label this with Discussion and you can mention or reach out to the Plan PM to expedite this if warranted. A salesperson for an organization asking for a paid-tier feature request shall work with the product manager to arrange conversations to further explore the feature request and desired outcome. The process will be: In the event that a paid customer is willing to pay for us to develop a specific feature, we should still respond as above. It’s great that they’re willing to pay for it: that means they really need it. However, we will not make a custom version of GitLab; even gitlab.com is running on GitLab Ultimate, and we move faster that way by minimizing technical complexity to determine features to follow after, it’s a trade-off to make. This doesn’t mean that “no” is always going to stay “no.” We keep an open mind to improvements. For example, they need support configuring a self-managed runner with a SaaS license. If you need support with a specific customer and your Customer Success Manager is unable to configure what is being requested or you are being asked to provide very specific guidelines for use of GitLab, we suggest creating an issue using the Product Support Request , and following the steps suggested in the issue. To remain focused on customer results and efficiency , we recommend setting a due date on the issue in 5 business days and assigning the issue to the Product Leader of the section for triage. Same as before, make sure an issue is made and make your case with the PM that this is becoming a problem and needs to be fixed. The PM will make sure that this is fixed or resolved in some other way. Everything in GitLab should be fast and creating files falls under the repository, so you create an issue and make the PM aware of it by mentioning it. The PM in turn will investigate whether this is a general problem or one specific to GitLab.com, in collaboration with infrastructure and others, and schedule any necessary changes for an upcoming release. The Product team maintains a Tableau dashboard to aggregate issues and customer interest in those issues. Information is automatically gathered from GitLab issues by scanning for Salesforce customer account links. The same dashboard can be used by Sales and CS. The Tableau page automation will detect when Salesforce links are added and use the customer’s Salesforce data, such as Total Account Value and seat licenses, to add them to the page. This also maintains a customer’s privacy on public issues, since Salesforce links are only accessible to GitLab employees with proper credentials. If your customer would like to report a bug, refer to the example of how to express the customer’s interest in an issue and use the Bug template, following the instructions and the same steps as above. You can refer to the following steps if a medium priority bug has become stale on the Product Management triage board . Another potentially helpful view is the triage report label . Follow the same steps as for logging and tracking bugs as with feature requests, but be sure that steps to reproduce and workarounds are included whenever possible. It is essential for the Product team and the CSM team to have a close working relationship, so that the business has a pulse on customer interests, feedback, and sentiment. If you are on the Product team and seeking feedback from customers, you should consult with the Customer Success Management organization, as CSMs have direct access and regular communication with customers across all regions, tiers, use cases, and industries. To request a meeting with a customer, open an issue in the CSM project and use the Product Engagement issue template, filling out the appropriate fields. If you have a specific customer in mind that you’d like feedback from, please share the customer name in the issue and tag the CSM assigned if you know who it is (you can find this information in Salesforce if you have access; otherwise, someone else will check for you). The CSM team gets notified via Slack whenever a new issue is opened, and they will respond in the issue with specific customers when they are available. If you don’t receive a response within a week (allowing the CSM to review with their customers), feel free to ping the @timtams group in the issue. One of the responsibilities of CSMs is collaborating with the Product team to help prioritize features by indicating demand from customers and relaying customers’ use cases and experiences. Following the process described below will ensure that customer interest in features is shared with Product properly, so that Product can take appropriate action. Through following the documented process, we are able to increase our efficiences, decrease back-and-forth communication, build a better product, and get answers and resolutions to customers faster. It can be very helpful for both Product and customers to be on a call together to discuss feedback, roadmaps, etc. Take the following steps to ensure an efficient and productive meeting: In advance to the product call, have a conversation with the customer about expectations and their background. Ask the following questions, as applicable: It is best practice to ask for a PM to join your call through the slack channel for their group or category . Direct messages are problematic because it is hard to loop in other PMs if the right person for the call is not included in the DM, and it limits visibility into topics that may be discussed. If you are unsure about the right group to reach out to, you can ask in the general #product channel. Before reaching out to the PM, fill out the PM Customer Meeting Briefing Document and send it to the PM along with your request. The PM will review the doc and let you know if they are able to attend the meeting. PMs may decline meeting requests if they do not receive the context doc or if it is only partially complete. We recommend sending this context along with your request at least 3 business days before the meeting. The PM will review the document and provide feedback to ask for further clarity if needed. In addition, once the call is scheduled, make sure you have a detailed agenda set at least 24 hours before the call that is shared with both the customer and the Product team. CSMs regularly hold Executive Business Reviews with their customers and often request involvement from Product Managers. When a CSM is looking for Product involvement, they will reach out to the PM (in their group Slack channel) with the date, time, and desired topic. The CSM will involve the PM in preparation for the EBR, working with them to ensure expectations of content, timing, and desired outcomes are fully established. EBRs are usually quite long (60-90 minutes) and the product presentation is only a small portion (15-20 minutes) of the overall EBR, so the PM is welcome to only join when they will be speaking. Of course, if they want to join and/or participate in the full call, that is definitely welcome, as customers often share product feedback and requests throughout an EBR. Throughout the customer lifecycle, customer-facing teams (Support, Account Executives, CSMs, Solutions Architects, Professional Services, Renewals Managers, etc.) may need the assistance of a Product Manager. This can include a detailed discussion of our direction, and how to address specific use cases, or gaps in functionality, within an organization. To ensure these requests can be quickly triaged, easily scheduled, and later tracked, there is a standardized request process based on issues. For time-sensitive and high-impact requests, please paste a link to the issue in the #product Slack channel, and @mention the recommended PM’s in the template. When a support request is opened, labels will automatically be assigned to categorize the request. Three fields are particularly important when triaging requests: All Product Managers should ensure they are set up to receive label notifications for their respective stages: GitLab is designed and developed in a unique way. Consistent with our value of Efficiency the product is developed with directly responsible individuals from Product, UX, Quality and Development working together. At GitLab, we develop our product for self-managed as well as SaaS-hosted customers. We realize that while we have DRIs there are many stakeholders who must have input, including Engineering, Quality, UX, Product, Security, and Infrastructure. For example, the Security team often has the deeper context of what it takes to run a secure SaaS system. Similarly, the Infrastructure team has insights into what we should build into the product to reduce toil and enable efficient, reliable, performant, and scalable systems. We call this the Product Group model. It is an extension of the classic quad concept at the leadership level and is currently comprised of Development, Quality, User Experience, Infrastructure, Product, and Security. The Product Group can be used to facilitate a global optimization , including product-wide technical debt . There are many counterparts that PMs work with. Here are some best practices for working across the organization. In some cases, Product Managers may have items that incur expenses toward the budget. These can be related to external vendors for research, contractors for development staffing, and infrastructure. The CProdO is the DRI for the product budget and all changes or requests for budget spend must be approved through them. To request a forward-looking new budget item, open an issue in the Product project using the Product Budget Request Template and assign it to the CProdO and manager. Budgets are planned annually and quarterly, so approval may not be immediately given because it depends on the timing of budget planning. The CProdO will bring the budget request to the next budget planning session with Finance. To request approval for an increase in the expected spend for a pre-existing item, open an issue in the Product project using the Product Budget Request Template assign to the CProdO and tag your manager. The CProdO will review, approve or decline the budget change. The CProdO will then notify the Finance Business Partner of changes for forecast updates. Content marketers and Product Managers can partner together when using a Blog to communicate product changes and engaging the market with thoughtful changes. See the blog post handbook page for guidelines on when and how to start engaging Content Marketing for creating a blog post for a feature. Product marketers and managers should be joined at the hip. Just as a feature without documentation should not be considered shipped, benefits of GitLab that we’re not actively talking about might as well not exist. Product marketers rely on product managers to be guided to what is important and high impact. In general, you should: A core element to use cases is effective objection handling against major competitors in the market. In order to effectively support this effort, a partnership between Product Marketing and Product Management to maintain adding competitor walkthroughs and competitive content to the existing use cases is critical. To date we have competitive sections on the following uses cases: In FY22-Q2, we are taking on an effort to continually update these Tier 1 and Tier 2 use cases and are assigning DRIs, follow along this effort in gitlab&1446 When working on the release of larger features or new capabilities, it is important the product manager consider various aspects of the go to market plan and inform or partner with the appropriate stable counterparts for strategic and logistical considerations. As a PM you’re responsible for making sure changes you’ve shipped are well represented throughout GitLab’s documentation and marketing materials. This means that on release, features.yml is updated, documentation is merged and deployed, and any existing content is updated where necessary. It’s not acceptable to do this after the release. GitLab is very complex, and features and functions are easily missed, even those that provide significant value to customers (e.g. the many ways you can authenticate with GitLab). You can recruit the help of the marketing and technical writing team if needed, but it’s highly recommended to do small updates yourself. This takes less time and overhead than communicating what needs to be done to someone else. It’s important to keep features.yml updated because there are a number of different pages (internal-facing and external-facing) that read from that file. These include: The standard for working as a team at GitLab is the Product Development Workflow . Product Managers and Product Designers should work together as strategic counterparts to better understand the problem and discover user needs. The Product Designer and the Product Manager will pair to understand the target audience, their challenges when using a particular feature and then designing a solution that helps users solve them. It’s important to remember that User Experience (UX) does not only relate to visual features or interface design. UX is the intangible design of a strategy that brings us to a solution, so it also refers to the experience of writing code, working with .yml files, designing APIs, working with a CLI, etc. All of those functionalities are meant to be read and used by people. Involving a Product Designer into their planning and development can be highly beneficial. A guide to consider is: anytime a person is interacting with something, there is an opportunity for that interaction to be designed. As the GitLab product matures, we know we must make important workflows easier to use through feedback-loop mechanisms as is captured in the “Improve” section of the Product Development Flow . We can use the Category Maturity Scorecards and UX scorecards as mechanisms to provide insights into how might be able to improve these user workflows. For areas with minimal maturity, or low/internal-only adoption, iteration and quickly adapting the product is the priority. In cases where the product experience desired would take longer to implement than required for the current maturity stage, it is advised the Product Manager work with the Product Designer and/or Engineering Manager to scope an iteration plan to ensure the experience is delivered incrementally over time to provide value quickly with quality. For areas with more adoption, or beyond viable maturity, we recommend using the below escalation path if there is a disagreement on the approach to solve for the product direction and experience for users/customers. As a team, there may be cases where a proposal exceeds the expected time to market to achieve the optimal customer experience. As this impacts potential business results, product managers are the DRIs of the decision. As DRIs, it is important to consider the input from other team members and to know when to trust in their experience and judgment. It is advised to use an opportunity canvas lite . The PM is expected to compile the canvas lite with inputs from the Product Designer and/or Engineering Manager. The PM then makes a decision after weighing input from the product designer and engineering, as appropriate. The PM should then share the decision, articulating the costs of waiting, and shipping earlier with less polish, as well as why no smaller iteration exists as part of this decision. In the event that a decision is made to build something that is less polished, has a lesser user experience, or otherwise doesn’t live up to our standards of where we want this UI to end up the team should generate follow-up Deferred UX issues to be addressed in the next upcoming milestone(s). If a quad member remains concerned and in strong disagreement with the decision made by the PM DRI, the quad member should exercise our disagree, commit, and disagree value , by initiating an escalation to bring in management layers above into the decision. Results are the most important aspect to consider for the business and our users. If there is a perceived risk to potentially harm the business financially, reduce customer satisfaction or value, or lead to legal trouble, teammates are empowered to seek an alternative perspective for the product decision. Within the Product Division, we recommend escalating first to the management layer immediately above where the disagreement is happening for input and further escalating to PLT and ultimately the Chief Product Officer. Product Designer assignments are listed in the team.yml file. Unfortunately, we are currently unable to assign a dedicated Product Designer for every group. Instead, Product Designers are assigned to the areas of highest business priority and will continue to provide focused support to those priorities throughout the year. Due to the limited capacity, we are also not able to do UX reviews on MRs for groups without a designer. If there isn’t a designer listed for a group, then that team is expected to be self-sufficient in taking responsibility for the design needs of their product area. Product Design does not have the capacity to review complex proposed design solutions or provide design solutions for unsupported groups. If you have questions or need support you can do so in the following ways: Here are some practices for how PMs work with groups outside of GitLab. Product managers are the DRI for their group’s product direction which must include delivering on our greater company strategy of dual flywheels. Community contributions are a critical part of the product direction. To support contributions product managers may consider the following guidelines:"

    "title": "Product Principles",
    "paragraph": "Principles - Processes - Categories - GitLab the Product - Being a PM - Leadership These are core principles that we believe will deliver world-class products through customer-centric innovation. Our goal is to build a practice that fosters these principles with the customers’ voice at the core. Everything we do is for our customers, and we are only successful when they succeed in delivering secure software faster to their customers and internal users. From development teams to marketing organizations, everyone needs to collaborate on digital content. Content should be open to suggestions by a wide number of potential contributors. Open contribution can be achieved by using a mergeable file format and distributed version control. The mission of GitLab is to allow everyone to collaborate on all digital content so people can cooperate effectively and achieve better results, faster. Ideas flow through many stages before they are realized. An idea originates in a chat discussion, an issue is created, it is planned in a sprint, coded in an IDE, committed to version control, tested by CI, code reviewed, deployed, monitored, and documented. Stitching together all these stages of the DevOps lifecycle can be done in many different ways. You can have a marketplace of proprietary apps from different suppliers or use a suite of products developed in isolation. As a single-application for the entire DevOps lifecycle, GitLab strives to enable you to bring ideas to production rapidly. We will do so AND avoid demonstrating our capabilities with toy app demos and simple trivial examples. That’s because we understand that building a prototype is easy, but building a production line is hard . Minimal Valuable Change (MVC) is the GitLab path to delivering the smallest measurable improvement for our users, customers, and the wider community. Our approach requires four pillars: When considering how to scope a feature for a release, remember that it is not ok to ship an “incomplete” feature to customers (see the definition of done ). Consider the use of Pajamas components for UI in your MVCs. When introducing a new component or pattern not found within Pajamas, it is the responsibility of that team to follow our component lifecycle guidelines to determine whether it should be added and, if so, contribute the addition/update back to Pajamas. MVC means reducing the scope so we can ship quickly. It doesn’t mean shipping something that hurts the usability of GitLab. First impressions are important. A feature that does not offer enough value or hinders the user experience may have a negative effect that discourages users from trying that feature again in the future. If there are obvious gaps in your MVC or you can anticipate follow-up requests, consider whether your feature is complete enough to be released to users. If you are unsure whether your feature is complete enough to be an MVC (or if you know your feature is not complete enough to be an MVC and you want to gather additional feedback), you can use approaches such as dogfooding, beta programs , feature flags, and/or user research to help build confidence in your decision. In terms of talking about your feature, it’s ok to add a release post item that announces your incomplete feature (making clear that it is an early iteration, and points to the direction for the feature) and follow up in a later release post with a new item when you’ve completed more of the functionality. As long as you call it cookie dough, not a cookie, it manages user expectations. There are scenarios when an MVC approach is not advised. These include: An MVC approach is a byproduct of our spirit of iteration. That means we break problems down as small as possible , and focus on reduced cycle time . Thinking iteratively is not always intuitive, and breaking certain topics or projects down can be challenging. Here’s a helpful video from our CEO with guidance on how to think more iteratively. Here is a great video that illustrates how to build MVCs using Iteration. It shows Lego climbing obstacles. The first design fails. The second one can climb a book and so on. It also illustrates how modularity and good interfaces help with iteration as things get complex. To ensure that our efforts consistently deliver value to our users, each iteration must adhere to the following guidelines: Success of an initiative is not measured by the deployment of a change or the completion of an iteration. True success is determined by whether the iteration achieved its predefined objectives, as evidenced by tangible business and product metrics. We celebrate achievements when we can clearly see that an iteration or launch has resulted in tangible value for our users. Humans tend to favor solutions that add features than solutions that remove them, even when removing features is more efficient - great PMs recognize this bias and utilize subtractive thinking to create great user experiences. Customers will tell us when we’re missing something they need, but they’re unlikely to explicitly tell us when we’re overwhelming them with unwanted features. However, we do have evidence that this challenge is already a consideration for us, as reflected consistently in our System Usability Scale verbatims . Here is an episode on the Hidden Brain podcast that explores this bias further. Our customers choose SaaS because it reduces their operating costs, helps them adopt the latest capabilities without performing upgrades, and provides them peace of mind of high availability. This principle implies the following: This principle does not mean SaaS only. For more information on parity between SaaS and self-managed, see our parity principle . An MVC approach allows for maximum feedback while iterating. To help gather that feedback, Product Managers are encouraged to create feedback issues ( example ) to consolidate suggestions and experiences from users. Consider mentioning the feedback issue in any release post items and related implementation issue(s) for awareness. It’s important that team members know they are encouraged by E-group to continue moving fast as GitLab grows and gets bigger as a company. This involves moving quickly even in the face of risk and complexity. In alignment with our transparency value , we’d like to celebrate examples of failures or mistakes that were made while moving fast, where we ultimately learned from it and moved on. The following failures provided by the product team are celebrated as opportunities to gain insight, share learnings and move on with additional knowledge: If you have a failure that can serve as a learning opportunity, please make an MR to this page Just because something is not invented here doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a perfect home within our solution. GitLab is an Open Core product and is part of the broader ecosystem of Open Source tools in the market. Every day there are new innovative open source tools out there that solve real-world customer problems; we should not be afraid of embedding these tools into our own products in order to solve those same problems for our customers too. Leveraging existing technology allows us to get to market much more quickly, to contribute to Open Source (and help strengthen Open Source as a whole), and allows us to focus our own people on making GitLab itself better. Building professional relationships with these tool creators also is a positive for GitLab since they may have important user perspectives around your categories. We have achieved many successes following this approach: There are also many more examples throughout the company where this has been successful. As a product manager you should be monitoring the world of Open Source as it relates to your area to see where new innovative tools are being developed, and not be afraid of integrating those. One thing to keep in mind, integrating could be anything from a blog post describing how the tool works together with GitLab all the way up to bundling it inside of our own installation, and this can evolve iteratively. We understand that a natural inclination when using application development tools is to create an array of buttons to press and knobs to turn. We believe, however, that adding options to an application does not necessarily improve the user’s experience of that application. The best way to serve our users is to create an application that reduces complexity while still offering the features they need. We admire other “convention over configuration” tools—like Ruby on Rails (the doctrine of which perfectly describes the value of integrated systems ), Ember , and Heroku —and we strive to offer the same advantages for continuous delivery of software. Furthermore, Ruby on Rails has significantly and positively influenced the Ruby community, uplifting the tool and making it more powerful and useful than ever before. We want GitLab to be to Kubernetes what Rails is to Ruby. You should prefer well-considered choices based on current best practices. Avoid unnecessary configuration. Avoid configuration to support fragile workflows. When considering adding new configuration, we follow the following principles: Sometimes fast deployments are needed to fix a service or application outage that can cost a business money and reputation, we understand time is of the essence in these situations. That’s why we believe giving the team control over this is important in crucial moments of the development lifecycle. Controls that prevent changes from reaching Production are okay as safeguards, but they should be able to be quickly removed or person with disability if necessary. When controls are changed in this way, logs or records should be created to support post-mortem analysis and allow for understanding why the control needed to be removed or disabled. We want to provide the same capabilities to end users regardless of the method they choose to use GitLab (GitLab SaaS, Dedicated or Self-managed). All GitLab SaaS environments leverage the same installation method available to self-managed users, with a different licensing structure. By designing and implementing features for self-managed, we achieve maximum parity between the various installations. In line with our SaaS-first principle, some features may be released on SaaS to gain operational experience and apply learnings prior to recommending and supporting customers using it. Features would be present on self-managed codebase but are person with disability until General Availability. For functionality where implementation may be especially challenging without cloud services, for example with AI, self-managed functionality may be dependent on an underlying SaaS service. This allows us to provide end users the same capabilities regardless of deployment type, and not overly constrain our feature set or impose significant operational complexities on each deployment. Product managers need to be aware that this may impact the adoption of these features, as not all customers may be willing or able to leverage underlying SaaS services, such as air-gapped deployments. Exception to this product principle requires CEO approval. Work with VP, Product Management to add your request to the Product Scale agenda describing the situation and request for exception to gain CEO approval. Our simplicity and SaaS/Self-Managed Parity principles require that we adhere to our established knowledge architecture. Our established architecture is Organization , Group and Project . Note: This implies that we will take pains to avoid instance-level features as we expect to move all capabilities from instance to organization over time. After making a tier decision on a new feature, we should strive to maximize the number of users who can use it. As part of this objective, we should avoid building instance-level features when possible. Building at the instance level (in the admin area ) leads to a separation between GitLab.com and self-managed and limits your audience to self-managed customers only: Historically (and even net-new proposed features) we’ve often started with an “instance-wide” mindset which then means we need to iterate and adjust features to work at a group-level. This often delays functionality for our SaaS customers and makes GitLab.COM feel like a second-class citizen. There are factors that may justify an instance-level feature, like engineering efficiency and high infrastructure cost , but we should always have a clear view on how we might bring the feature to GitLab.com and clearly document why we started with the instance-level in the issue. Product Managers at GitLab are frequently confronted with the choice of whether to add new configurations or not. These can frequently be times where an outside perspective is important. That’s why we’ve created the option to request a New Config Review . Here’s an example of how to consider whether to add new configuration. Let’s say you are proposing we add a checkbox or two radio boxes in a feature dialog box. Think carefully about what users really want. Most of the time, you’ll find you really only need one solution, so remove the other option. When two possible choices really are necessary, the best or most common one should be the default, and the other one should be available. If the non-default choices are significantly less common, then consider taking them out of the main workflow for making decisions, by putting them behind an Advanced configuration tab, for example. Avoiding configurations is not always possible. When we have no choice, the secondary priority is to configure something in the GitLab interface. A configuration should only appear in a file ( gitlab.rb or gitlab.yml ) as a last resort. When you have to add a new configuration, make sure that the features and services are on by default. Only add a configuration line to either of these configuration files if the feature or service cannot be fully person with disability from the admin UI. If the decision to add a configuration follows the principles above , add it to the repository-specific CI configuration options and be sure to default it to the option that results in the best user experience. We are much more liberal with additions to CI configurations than Instance configurations. Features should be owned by one group, including the respective DRIs of that group. Make sure that the documentation metadata and the features.yml for your team are kept up to date to make it easier for other teams to find the correct owner. This principle is important because unowned product features are unsupervised, and continue to accrue technical debt over time. This increases the risk of performance and maintenance issues, which tend to only get resolved once the situation has become critical. In addition, by having clear DRIs for our entire surface area, teams are able to advocate for investment and/or removal of features. If you encounter a feature that does not seem to be owned or documented, work with the team that originally introduced the functionality to decide on ownership. If the feature is large and needs to be broken down, document which elements are owned by which team. If you cannot decide who should own the feature, escalate the decision to the lowest common reporting line between the involved teams. If there are features that no group wants to own, or features that a group no longer wants to own, that feature should be considered for deprecation and removal. A highly usable interface with cohesive workflows and comprehensive documentation is a must to stay ahead of our best-in-class competitors. Work closely with the individuals in UX to achieve our user experience goals. The UX team has a high level of expertise in Product Design, Technical Writing, and UX Research. They can help decipher or decide how to simplify or avoid complexity. While our Product Designers review user interface changes in merge requests , they are not limited to just the UI. Anything that impacts the user journey is relevant to them. Keep in mind these general user experience principles. Additionally, you can familiarize yourself with the UX team mission and GitLab’s Pajamas design system principles . Many crazy, over-ambitious ideas sound like they are impossible just because no one else is doing them. Since we have amazing engineers and a culture of shipping minimal valuable changes, we are able to accomplish many more “impossible” things than other organizations. That’s why we’re shipping merge conflict resolution, why we shipped built-in CI before anyone else, why we built a better static pages solution, and why we’re able to compete. Here at GitLab, we are an ambitious company and this means we aim for big things with every release. The reality of taking chances and planning aspirationally means that we won’t always be able to deliver everything that we wanted to try in every release, and similar to our OKRs , we believe this is a good thing. We don’t want to shy away from challenging ourselves and always want to keep a sense of urgency, and aiming for more helps us do that. Also see the importance of velocity We arrived at our preference for ambitious planning after measuring our velocity and finding that our velocity was unchanged whether we scheduled ambitiously or scheduled for providing slack. Discovering new features can enhance the experience and unlock significant value for users. And the more users see and try our features, the faster we can get feedback to improve them. However, excessive feature discovery efforts can become irritating for users. This erodes trust and reduces engagement with other UI elements in the future. Even worse, they might leave GitLab due to this deteriorating experience. Context plays a significant role in how users engage with new functionality. By presenting features in a way that resonates with a user’s current situation and needs you increase the liklihood of them using this new functionality. Work with your product designer to improve the discoverability of your features. The Pajamas Design System has best practices and examples to support feature discoverability . We can also design new patterns. The Growth team can also help you with this, as they think about things like onboarding new users and promoting feature use within the app while supporting, not annoying, the user. As the GitLab userbase and team members who work on GitLab continue to grow we need to support both our users and team members by helping to connect users who may be interested in speaking with a member of the sales team to that particular person. We can call this a Product Qualified Lead or a PQL. Our goal is to develop a world-class PQL system whereby we monitor product usage to understand and constantly iterate on what constitutes a usage-based PQL and provide a unified intelligent interface in the product where users can submit a hand-raise, start a trial or upgrade touchlessly. By monitoring product usage, usage PQL volume, SAO rate, and ASP we will be able to work in partnership with marketing and sales to ensure we’re sending high quality leads to the sales team. In the product experience, we will develop an intelligent module for feature discovery moments whereby we help recommend what we believe should be the preferred option for the user whether it’s a hand-raise, trial or touchless upgrade by updating the default CTA based on their usage of the product along with demographic and firmographic data. This experience will be present on both SaaS and self-managed instances for air-gapped instances the CTAs will provide the user with external URLs to visit to complete the associated step. This experience should be able to be deployed by any stage to further their paid adoption rate. Users can only experience GitLab’s value when they actively use the product features. Therefore the Product team’s mission isn’t only shipping features and building products, but also driving usage and delivering value. There are two frameworks we use to think about driving GitLab’s product usage: we use the AARRR framework to think about how to drive a single feature’s usage, and use the Customer Adoption Journey to think about cross-adoption of product features. These two frameworks are also interconnected with each other. AARRR stands for Acquisition , Activation , Retention , Revenue , and Referral which is often referred to as “Pirate Metrics” . These five words represent the customer journey and the various means a product manager may apply Product Performance Indicators to drive a desired behavior in the funnel. While the AARRR framework is commonly used to drive overall active users, it is also a great way for PMs to think about how to drive feature usage. Add AARRR funnels for your stage or group’s Product Performance Indicators directly with mermaid markdown. It’s easy if you use this live editor . Product managers can use these various states to prioritize features that drive a desired action. This could mean focusing on the Activation metric to drive awareness and generate more top of funnel leads. As an example, in the Release stage the Release Management group tracks actions on the Release Page in GitLab. Users that view a Release Page have been acquired and those that create a release on a Release Page are activated users. The Product Manager can choose to target features that drive users to view the Release Page more, resulting in a greater interest in the number of users that become activated and create their own Releases. GitLab is a complete DevOps platform. Our customers get the most value out of the GitLab product when they use multiple features together. Below is the most common path our customers follow to adopt GitLab’s product stages. As PMs, in addition to driving usage of individual features, we should also proactively think about how to design product and user experiences to help users adopt more stages and features, therefore benefiting more from using GitLab. Note: There are numerous potential variants to this adoption journey, but it’s important to keep this representation simple and consistent. Please check with David DeSanto first before making any changes to the adoption journey image. Shipping only MVCs can result in a large set of loosely connected pieces that don’t necessarily combine into a single, great user experience. An obvious solution to this would be to plan out the future in detail, creating a long-term detailed plan. However, this is unwanted as it can restrict your flexibility and ability to respond to changing needs or feedback. Flow One offers an alternative. You draw out a workflow consisting of MVCs (that can be shipped individually). The workflow should only cover a specific, narrow use-case, and nothing more. Flow One should cover the first iteration of a particular workflow. After this, individual MVCs can be introduced to expand the use-cases or loosen the assumptions (e.g. from a feature that can only be used if you’re using feature branches, to one that works for other git strategies). Using data to learn from our users is important. Our users are spread across GitLab.com and self-managed instances, so we have to focus our efforts on learning and providing benefit to both when we decide to collect more data, or build and use additional analytics tools. If we do this, we can help make the rest of the company successful as well. This means that we should: Per GitLab Stewardship , we will not introduce artificial limits in Core. Artificial means arbitrarily setting a small number (such as: 1) as a limit on a given GitLab object category, that would incur no additional effort or cost had we chosen a larger number. The additional effort includes product, design, and engineering effort to create the feature in the first place, and to maintain it over time. For example, GitLab Core has the issue board feature in every project. In GitLab EE, each project supports multiple boards . This does not mean that Core has an artificial limit of one board per project, because there is additional effort to manage multiple boards such as supporting the navigation interface, and all the associated engineering work. This principle does not apply to our SaaS offering as limits are occasionally introduced to limit our hosting costs and protect other users from potential abuse. As an example we have shared runner minute quotas and implement rate limiting . We’re discussing enforced workflows in this issue . Enforced workflows should be avoided in GitLab. For example, there are three issue states ( Open , In Progress (as of 10.2), and Closed ), and any issue should be allowed to transition from one state to any other state without workflow restrictions. (Roles and permissions is a separate concern.) A comment on Hacker News perfectly details what can go wrong when enforcing workflows: “The down side for the true end-users, those who actually use the software day-to-day, is that most business processes are awful. If your experience is the hellish existence that I see strolled about on threads where JIRA comes up ...: But that comment also specifies the advantage: “JIRA’s most powerful feature is that it affords for mapping businesses processes onto software. This is incredibly compelling to enterprise customers. Software that enforces workflows, procedures and requirements can be an incredible lever and JIRA’s price point makes build vs buy decisions an absolute no-brainer.” We should ensure that GitLab makes it easy to help with enterprise workflows: When considering a customer need for enforcement or limitations: As an example, customers requested instance-wide enforcement through required CI jobs. Doing this would have been a mistake. Instead: Small primitives are building blocks in GitLab. They are an abstraction not at the technical level, but truly at the product level. Small primitives can be combined, built-upon further, and otherwise leveraged to create new functionality in GitLab. For example, the label lists in issue boards use the smaller primitive of labels . They are especially powerful because they usually take less effort and provide higher leverage than you would get from a more “complete” but standalone feature. Think of how simple Unix command line utilities can be chained together to do really complicated things, much easier (and certainly more flexibly) than you could have done with a dedicated tool. When iterating on GitLab, strongly consider using small primitives instead of creating new abstractions, especially when considering MVC features that will provide the foundations for further improvements. To do this you can start with easy to apply concepts that meet the needs of intermediate to advanced users; from here document the usage clearly and be sure to think about discoverability. The UX can very often be refactored or enhanced later when there’s a demonstrated need for refinement, onboarding for less sophisticated users, or other new abstractions needed that were identified through real-world usage. In GitLab the product, it is sometimes the case that optional software or infrastructure is required to enable new capabilities. Some examples include: The following are best practices we consider when building such components. As we learned with GitLab CI/CD, the ability for developers to quickly attach needed Runners to enable their own use of GitLab CI/CD allowed for rapid adoption of GitLab CI/CD within an organization. When considering the workflow to enable additional capabilities, start with enabling developers first. A guiding principle should be low-friction developer enablement, which will positively impact adoption. As we learned from the certificate-based Kubernetes Integration, building starting experiences that support demoing a getting-started process doesn’t necessarily translate into real usage. For example, the certificate-based integration lacked strong security primitives and the ability to manage the integration on an ongoing basis. As a result, we should build capabilities that target real-world production use first, even as part of MVCs. GitLab’s vision is to be the best single application for every part of the DevOps toolchain. However, some customers use tools other than our included features, and we respect those decisions. With this in mind, it’s sometimes valuable to integrate with 3rd-party services and products to help bridge the gaps in their toolchain. While a single application is the best approach, multiple applications that work well together is better than ones that don’t. With this in mind, below are some product guidelines to consider: Note - We intend to provide a place where everyone can contribute, such as code snippets , project templates and CI components in the CI/CD Catalog . Marketplaces are traditionally transaction based, where users are purchasing solutions. GitLab CI/CD components on the other hand, will offer an in product experience for consuming components for YAML configuration from a library of GitLab maintained components . Closed source software vendors commonly depend on plugins and commercial marketplaces because: Because GitLab is an open core product , third parties can add functionality directly to GitLab. Adding directly to the GitLab codebase (as opposed to building a plugin) may mean more work for them and will limit the ways in which they can charge for that functionality. However, for users of GitLab , this has significant advantages: And for developers of GitLab including the third parties, this has significant advantages as well: Overall, we believe that this approach creates the best possible experience for both the users of and the contributors to GitLab, and to that end we encourage people to contribute functionality to GitLab directly . If adding code directly to GitLab isn’t an option, we encourage third-parties to integrate through our APIs . Note: GitLab does support plugins that respond to system hooks , which tie directly to application events and are primarily used for administrative purposes such as auditing, logging, and other administrative tasks. GitLab is a DevOps Platform, not a collection of DevOps point solutions; the naming of GitLab products and features should reflect this. Adopting descriptive names brings other advantages: As an example , CI/CD Components Library is a descriptive name while CI/CD ATOM is a distinctive name. Exceptions to this principle are considered in limited circumstances - if a product or feature is a differentiator in the market, adopting a descriptive name risks it getting lost in the sea of same . Here, a distinctive name may be justified. To discuss an exception, reach out to #marketing in Slack. When naming a GitLab extension, plugin, app, or integration for a third-party product or service (a “tool”), either include the third-party service name with a preposition like for , or don’t include it at all. A preposition is important as it indicates that the third party isn’t officially affiliated with the tool. For example, our integration with Jira Cloud is called GitLab.com for Jira Cloud . Provided we use the tool’s full name in marketing materials and technical documentation, as exceptions to this general principle we can: (1) refer to the tool solely by the third-party service name in places where we list GitLab’s tools in product; and (2) refer to the tool solely as “GitLab” in the third-party product’s app directory. For example, we refer to the GitLab for Slack app as “Slack” in our lists of GitLab integrations, and as “GitLab” in the Slack App Directory . For more guidance on the feature naming process, see naming features . While our big, hairy, audacious goal spans all development processes, personas, and use-cases, there are primary targets in each one of these venues. When considering prioritization we should first aim to provide complete maturity for developers building cloud native applications in a modern way prior to moving to other development methodologies, personas, and application types. When developing features to compete with existing competitors, make sure to solve problems for modern development teams first, and then see what’s missing for legacy teams. e.g. For project management, make great project management capabilities for teams doing conversational development, lean, or even agile development before doing Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) or waterfall. It’s important that modern first does not mean non-modern never. It means that we should first learn how teams are using the feature in a modern way, and then see what’s missing. The modern way provides the path forward, and then we can add customizability or the path to modern for teams who are not quite there yet. Our strategy includes going after a lot of new personas, going from developers to operations, security, product managers, designers, etc. But when developing features in these new areas, it’s important to remember to start with the developer. If we can make security great for developers and then great for security professionals, we’ll be much more successful. Development teams deploy to tons of different platforms, from bare metal to cloud VMs to cloud-native Kubernetes clusters. We build features for cloud-native first, and then support the rest. This allows us to focus on where development is going, and deliver solutions that every company aspires to use eventually, even if they’re not ready to today. By focusing on next-generation development flows, personas, and use cases - we build features and experiences where our initial users are in the relatively small population of early adopters. While we might build experiences to support them today, we presume there will always be a much larger population of future users of these experiences. Therefore, we optimize GitLab to support the larger number of current and future adopters of next-generation principles - those who are beginning to operate in the workflow (modern), team setup (developer first), or application architectures (cloud native) we support. We focus our investment in the most modern workflows that will best support those current adopters. This will come at the cost of sustained investment in initial workflows for early adopters. When doing so we will ensure we clearly communicate with our users what the preferred path is. For example - We first provided the ability to attach Kubernetes Clusters via the Certificate method. After realizing this wasn’t optimal for production use cases we added the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes method of cluster attachment. As soon as we were certain that the certificate method was no longer the preferred method we communicated via our docs and in the product that the Agent was the preferred path for current adopters. This should not mean an immediate deprecation , but a clear signal that the legacy method will become deprecated once the alternative approach is able to substitute it. We provide customer support to paying customers on all features that are in the tier of their paid license as well as any lower tiers. This means a feature in Core, should get customer support in all paid tiers. For example, when there is a feature that is available in the lowest paid tier, but only has customer support in higher tiers, the feature should be removed from that lowest paid tier. In accordance with our stewardship policy we can never remove features from Core into paid tiers, but we can build additional features around it which are available to paying customers only."

    "title": "Product Processes",
    "paragraph": "Principles - Processes - Categories - GitLab the Product - Being a PM - Leadership As a Product Organization, we work to create a flexible yet concise product development framework for developing products that customers love and value. The Product Principles section is where you can learn about our strategy and philosophy regarding product development, here we discuss the processes we use tactically. Introducing changes requires a number of steps, with some overlap, that should be completed in order. GitLab follows a dual-track product development flow spanning product, engineering, UX, and quality. We use GitLab to power product development flow . When changes are released, we follow the release post process to communicate externally about new capabilities. This process should be both up front and on an on-going basis when building features. Documenting a Section, Stage, Group and Category direction is critical to communicating where we are heading and why to all of our stakeholders. We document our direction in direction pages. Read more about related processes under Planning and Direction . In November 2024 we adjusted our communicated touch points based on feedback from our FY25-Q2 Engagement Survey , AMAs, skip levels, and 1:1s. The two key areas we are prioritizing: When communicating change or a request for action to the entire product function, utilize the following levels and corresponding activities. Before shipping a new or updated feature, you are responsible for championing it, both internally and externally. When something is released, the following teams need to be aware of it as they will all need to do something about it: You can promote your work in several ways: When referencing issues in written communication using just the issue number #123456 and a link is not low-context communication . Instead use the title of the issue and the link or the issue number and description of the problem that issue will solve: In order to support findability and to clearly articulate when we change our minds especially when it comes to product direction, category changes, shifts in investment themes, or priorities for engineering, Product Managers must evangelize these changes in multi-modal communication channels to ensure our users and customers aware. Some internal methods for communication include: External channels for consideration linking direction pages to: When conducting End-of-Line testing that may impact internal workflows or customer-facing demonstrations, product teams should coordinate internal announcements to avoid surprises for field team members who demo to customers. This communication is a product-led responsibility, with product managers coordinating with their engineering counterparts to ensure appropriate stakeholder notification. As a PM, it is important to remember a bias towards action (and other value actions like sense of urgency , make a proposal , boring solutions , write things down , don’t wait , and make two way doors decisions which enables PMs to drive an async discussion to being action oriented. Every time you write a comment or create an issue ask yourself: Will this allow us to take an action and move us forward? As PMs we need to constantly write about the features and upgrades we ship: in a blog post, internally to promote something, and in emails sent to customers. There are some guidelines that one should take into account when writing about features, the most important being a clear communication of the problem we’re solving for users. When writing about a feature, make sure to cover these messaging guidelines which help produce clear internal and external messaging. Please also keep in mind that we should avoid using acronyms that others my not recognize, such as “MVC” for Minimal Valuable Change. For more guidance you can visit our writing style guidelines . Let’s highlight the messaging guidelines mentioned above with a concrete example, Preventing Secrets in your repositories, that we shipped in 8.12 . It’s a bad idea to commit secrets (such as keys and certificates) to your repositories: they’ll be cloned to the machines of anyone that has access to the repository. If just a single one is insecure, the information will be compromised. Unfortunately, it can happen quite easily. You write git commit -am 'quickfix' && git push and suddenly you’ve committed files that were meant to stay local! GitLab now has a new push rule that will prevent commits with secrets from entering the repository. Just check the checkbox in the repository settings, under push rules and GitLab will prevent common unsafe files such as .pem and .key from being committed. Here are some additional examples of well written release blog posts for inspiration: In addition to the written medium, video is an important medium that caters to the different goals you are trying to accomplish and learning styles of your audience. Depending on the type of video you are recording, there are some guidelines to keep in mind. As our documentation guidelines actively encourage linking video content, please consider following the Documentation Style Guide section on language , and working with your technical writing team to include links to your speed runs, walk-throughs and demos at relevant locations in the product documentation. Animated GIFs are an awesome way of showing of features that need a little more than just an image, either for marketing purposes or explaining a feature in more detail. Checkout our guide to Making Gifs ! Speed runs are informal videos meant to focus on a single workflow and the experience for performing that workflow. It should not require much planning and is typically short in duration (less than 5 min.). This video type is meant to inform and not necessarily to influence buyers. Demos are scripted recordings meant to influence buyers. Generally has higher production value and typically involves both a slide-style presentation and/or live screen-sharing. Duration varies depending on the topics being covered. Product walk-throughs are informal videos meant primarily for an internal audience as a recorded, visual form of product critique. Walk-throughs typically focus on the user experience across categories and workflows within a Product Manager’s product scope . There are particular benefits to walk-throughs which span product hierarchy boundaries (multi-category, multi-stage, multi-section) as they help highlight disjointed experiences across our single-application. Walk-throughs are typically longer in length as they cover more ground and often involve some “live” troubleshooting and are best performed with no planning. Use the Product walk-through issue template when creating a walk-through. After the feature freeze, it’s expected of each product manager to test their own features and perform quality assurance to the best of their ability and follow up where necessary. Product managers can use the staging environment once the release managers have deployed a release candidate (RC) to staging. Release managers should post in the #product channel in Slack that a new release candidate is available. Product managers can also use other environments as needed, such as GitLab provisioned on Kubernetes with GKE. Before a new feature is shipped, the PM should test it out to make sure it solves the original problem effectively. This is not about quality assurance (QA), as developers are responsible for the quality of their code. This is about feature assurance (FA). FA is necessary because sometimes there are misunderstandings between the original issue proposal and the final implementation. Sometimes features don’t actually solve the intended problem, even though it seemed like it would, and sometimes solutions just don’t feel as useful as intended when actually implemented. If you can test out the feature during development, pulling down branches locally (or with a review app!), that’s great. But sometimes it’s not feasible to test a feature until it’s bundled into a release candidate and deployed to GitLab.com. If so, make sure to test out features as soon as possible so any new issues can be addressed before final release. Also, take the FA cycle into account when scheduling new milestone work. If you are looking to test code that has not been merged to GitLab.com or is not yet part of an RC, you can pull the branch down locally and test it using the GitLab Development Kit (GDK). Quality Engineering Managers (QEM) are the DRIs for prioritizing bugs. These include security issues which are prioritized in conjunction with the security team. Product Managers must work with their QEM to set Milestones for issues marked with the bug::vulnerability type label to guarantee they are shipped by their due date, as defined in the Security Team process . While Product Managers are the DRIs for milestone planning , they must respect the prioritization order for bugs and maintenance issues as determined by their QEM and EM, respectively. As such they should deeply understand the implications and risks of security-related issues and balance those when prioritizing a milestone work. Addressing a serious security issue by its due date may require temporarily adjusting the desired work type ratio for one or more milestones. Priority labels and Due Date designations for security issues should never be modified by Product Managers as they are directly managed by the Security Team and used to track metrics and progress. When thinking about new features, we must not only think about the functional requirements of a feature (defining what the feature will do), but also to think about foundational requirements (defining how the feature works). At the highest level, foundational requirements define items such as performance, scalability, compatibility, maintainability and usability characteristics of a feature. It is important to have foundational requirements in place up front, as this is much easier than trying to add them later and change expectations, or break existing workflows. Our definition of done contains specific areas of consideration that are required for the acceptance of new contributions. For an in depth review of foundational requirements (often referred to as non-functional requirements), see this resource . To deliver features, we must have both functional and foundational requirements defined. To enhance availability and performance of GitLab, configurable limits should be put in place for features which utilize storage, or scale in a manner which could impact performance. For example, we limit the number of webhooks per project , and we allow admins to set rate limits on raw endpoints . These limits ensure more consistent performance, reduce the likelihood of outages, and offer admins tools to limit abuse or enforce specific standards. While these limits can be configurable, sensible default limits should be defined for our GitLab SaaS and GitLab dedicated offerings. There is a guide about developing application limits in the GitLab Docs. See Rate Limiting::Managing Limits . As we continue to scale our product, we need to consider the amount of data being stored for new features. Data storage is not an infinite resource, so we should think carefully about what data needs persistent storage to provide the desired user experience. We also need to consider the cost implications around data storage. Everything we store impacts our bottom line, and we should therefore be careful to ensure we are only storing necessary data for well thought out time-frames. We are working on defining a sustainable data retention policy , and will iterate on this section as more general guidelines are developed. Data storage comes in three main forms for GitLab – object storage, database storage, and Git repository storage. While we have dedicated teams devoted to ensuring we can scale these storages appropriately, it is in our best interest to only store what is required for a feature to perform as intended. Additionally, there are situations where storage should be subject to data retention policies. When evaluating feature data storage, the following data storage topics should be considered. A good example where we’ve successfully evaluated data storage is our CI/CD Artifacts. We’ve set some sane default values for both maximum artifact size and for default artifacts expiration , while making these both configurable for administrative users. See this page for details on working across stages at GitLab. Stages, groups, and categories serve as a common framework for organizing and communicating the scope of GitLab. If you follow the principles and workflow above, you won’t be writing long, detailed specs for a part of the product for next year. So how should you be spending your time? Invest the majority of your time (say 70%) in deeply understanding the problem. Then spend 10% of your time writing the spec for the first iteration only and handling comments, and use the remaining 20% to work on promoting it. A problem you understand well should always have a (seemingly) simple or obvious solution. Reduce it to its simplest form (see above) and only ship that. See the Cross-Functional Prioritization page for more information. *indicates forced prioritization items with SLAs/SLOs Any of the items with a “*” are considered issues driven by the attached SLO or SLA and are expected to be delivered within our stated policy. There are two items that fall into Forced Prioritization: Any issues outside of these labels are to be prioritized using cross-functional prioritization . Auto-scheduling issues based on automation or triage policies are not forced prioritization. These issues can be renegotiated for milestone delivery and reassigned by the DRI. While we have moved to the cross-functional prioritization process to empower teams to determine the optimal balance of all types of issues, we will keep Engineering Allocations as a way to allow teams to quickly shift to a critical priority, designating the EM as the DRI to drive the effort. Engineering is the DRI for mid/long term team efficiency, performance, security (incident response and anti-abuse capabilities), availability, and scalability. The expertise to proactively identify and iterate on these is squarely in the Engineering team. Whereas Product can support in performance issues as identified from customers. In some ways these efforts can be viewed as risk-mitigation or revenue protection. They also have the characteristic of being larger than one group at the stage level. Development would like to conduct an experiment to focus on initiatives that should help the organization scale appropriately in the long term. We are treating these as a percent investment of time associated with a stage or category. The percent of investment time can be viewed as a prioritization budget outside normal Product/Development assignments. Engineering Allocation is also used in short-term situations in conjunction and in support of maintaining acceptable Error Budgets for GitLab.com and our GitLab-hosted first theme. Unless it is listed in this table, the Engineering Allocation for a stage/group is 0% and we are following normal prioritization . Refer to this page for Engineering Allocation charting efforts. Some stage/groups may be allocated at a high percentage or 100%, typically indicating a situation where all available effort is to be focused on Reliability related (top 5 priorities from prioritization table ) work. During an Engineering Allocation, the EM is responsible for recognizing the problem, creating a satisfactory goal with clear success criteria, developing a plan, executing on a plan and reporting status. It is recommended that the EM collaborate with PMs in all phases of this effort as we want PMs to feel ownership for these challenges. This could include considering adding more/less allocation, setting the goals to be more aspirational, reviewing metrics/results, etc. We welcome strong partnerships in this area because we are one team even when allocations are need to resolving issues critical to our business. During periods of Engineering Allocation, the PM remains the interface between the group and the fields teams & customers. This is important because: Each allocation has a direction page maintained by the Engineering Manager. The Engineering Manager will provide regular updates to the direction page. Steps to add a direction page are: To see an example for an Engineering Allocation Direction page, see Continuous Integration Scaling . Once the Engineering Allocation is complete, delete the direction page. One of the most frequent questions we get as part of this experiment is “How does a problem get put on the Engineering Allocation list?”. The short answer is someone makes a suggestion and we add it. Much like everyone can contribute, we would like the feedback loop for improvement and long terms goals to be robust. So everyone should feel the empowerment to suggest an item at any time. To help with getting items that on the list for consideration, we will be performing a survey periodically. The survey will consist of the following questions: We will keep the list of questions short to solicit the most input. The survey will go out to members of the Development, Quality, Security. After we get the results, we will consider items for potential adding as an Engineering Allocation. Once the item’s success criteria are achieved, the Engineering Manager should consult with counterparts to review whether the improvements are sustainable. Where appropriate, we should consider adding monitoring and alerting to any areas of concern that will allow us to make proactive prioritizations in future should the need arise. The Engineering Manager should close all related epics/issues, reset the allocation in the above table to the floor level, and inform the Product Manager when the allocated capacity will be available to return their focus to product prioritizations. When reseting a groups Engineering Allocation in the table above, the goal should be set as floor % , the goal should be empower every SWEs from raising reliability and security issues , percentage of headcount allocated should be 10% , and N/A in place of a link to the Epic. All engineering allocation closures should be reviewed and approved by the VP of Development . A Feature Change Lock (FCL) is a process to improve the reliability and availability of GitLab.com. We will enact an FCL anytime there is an S1 or public-facing (status page) S2 incident on GitLab.com (including the License App, CustomersDot, and Versions) determined to be caused by an engineering department change. The team involved should be determined by the author, their line manager, and that manager’s other direct reports. If the incident meets the above criteria, then the manager of the team is responsible for: If the team believes there does not need to be an FCL, approval must be obtained from either the VP of Infrastructure or VP of Development. Direct reports involved in an active borrow should be included if they were involved in the authorship or review of the change. The purpose is to foster a sense of ownership and accountability amongst our teams, but this should not challenge our no-blame culture. Rough guidance on timeline is provided here to set expectations and urgency for an FCL. We want to balance moving urgently with doing thoughtful important work to improve reliability. Note that as times shift we can adjust accordingly. The DRI of an FCL should pull in the timeline where possible. The following bulleted list provides a suggested timeline starting from incident to completion of the FCL. “Business day x” in this case refers to the x business day after the incident. During the FCL, the team(s) exclusive focus is around reliability work , and any feature type of work in-flight has to be paused or re-assigned. Maintainer duties can still be done during this period and should keep other teams moving forward. Explicitly higher priority work such as security and data loss prevention should continue as well. The team(s) must: After the Incident Review is completed, the team(s) focus is on preventing similar problems from recurring and improving detection. This should include, but is not limited to: Examples of this work include, but are not limited to: Any work for the specific team kicked off during this period must be completed, even if it takes longer than the duration of the FCL. Any work directly related to the incident should be kicked off and completed even if the FCL is over. Work paused due to the FCL should be the priority to resume after the FCL is over. Items created for other teams or on a global level don’t affect the end of the FCL. A stable counterpart from Infrastructure will be available to review and consult on the work plan for Development Department FCLs. Infrastructure FCLs will be evaluated by an Infrastructure Director. Please also note the corresponding Engineering handbook section about the relative importance and prioritization of availability, security, and feature velocity. To ensure we’re providing an appropriate focus on security, data loss, and availability, PMs should consider: To help PMs plan, stage group stable counterparts can participate in prioritization sessions. They serve mainly as an internal sensing mechanism for PMs to make more informed prioritization decisions for different planning horizons. Usually, teams focus on the product releases horizon, but can also focus on the FY themes or strategy horizons. This group exercise also boosts team morale, improves communication and empathy, and broadens individual’s perspectives. Besides, it can be a more informal and joyful way of connecting the team and discussing work. The output of these sessions is a priority matrix that shows the relative priority of a set of items based on two weighted criteria. Generally, the criteria are importance and feasibility , each one visualized as an axis of the matrix. You can change the criteria depending on the planning horizon or goals. To better understand how the sessions work, see an example mural and session recording . Always consider asynchronous sessions first, in an effort to be more inclusive and respectful of others time. That said, if possible, synchronous sessions can be ideal, as they allow limiting the time spent and make great use of the activities’ momentum for a more efficient discussion and voting. Use our Mural template for prioritization sessions , built for product releases but adaptable for other planning horizons or criteria. Adapt this process as needed, and consider changing it to an asynchronous mode of communication. For example, participants can review the items async, add questions as comments in Mural , and vote using dot voting or in voting sessions held on different days for each criterion. RICE is a useful framework for prioritization that can help you stack rank your issues. The RICE framework is a great tool for prioritizing many issues that seem to be of equal value at first glance. In order to drive clarity and alignment in the prioritization of work across the entire DevOps platform, and to help prioritize items that may compete for resources from different teams, we have set a standard for the RICE factors so all prioritization decisions based on RICE are using the same metric. Reach How many customers will benefit in the first quarter after launch? Data sources to estimate this might include qualitative customer interviews, customer requests through Support/CS/Sales , upvotes on issues, surveys, etc. Higher reach means a higher RICE score: Impact How much will this impact customers and GitLab? Impact could take the form of increased revenue, decreased risk, and/or decreased cost (for both customers and GitLab). This makes it possible to compare revenue generating opportunities vs. non-revenue generating opportunities. Potential for future impact should also be taken into account as well as the impact to the GitLab brand (for example unlocking free-to-paid conversion opportunities). Higher impact means a higher RICE score: Confidence How well do we understand the customer problem? How well do we understand the solution and implementation details? Higher confidence means a higher RICE score. Effort How many person months do we estimate this will take to build? Lower effort means a higher RICE score. These four factors can then be used to calculate a RICE score via the formula: (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort = RICE Here is an example RICE calculation you can use to help prioritize work in your area. Feel free to embed this at the Epic level to provide context for why you did or did not prioritize. Other important considerations: We schedule a prioritized issue by assigning it a milestone; for more on this see Planning a Future Release. Conducting a RICE prioritization exercise with your cross-functional counterparts is a powerful way to make the process more inclusive and improve the quality of your rankings. Consider making this an async-first process to accommodate team members across different timezones. For an example of how to do this async-first, see this issue that the Geo team used to collaborate on a RICE prioritization exercise. This blank async RICE template is also available for you to copy for your own async prioritization exercise. For prioritizing most issues, we should utilize the RICE framework noted above , which will capture an aggregate of customer demand. You can also augment RICE scores with the Customer Issues Prioritization Framework Dashboards : Customer Requested Issues (Product) for product managers Customer Requested Issues (CSM) for Sales, CS and CSM These dashboards provide several inputs for calculating RICE and aggregate all customer requested issues and epics into a single dashboard. These dashboards are not meant as a replacement or sole input for Top ARR Drivers for Sales/CS . Further requirements such as the integration of themes need to be implemented before this framework can be used to fully inform or replace tools such as the Top ARR tracker . In some cases however, we may become aware of a feature which is particularly important to deliver on by a certain date. Examples of this could include an issue necessary to embark on a new GitLab rollout, a feature needed by a partner to launch an integration, or a method to import data from a service which is being discontinued. In these instances, the responsible PM can apply the customer or customer+ label along with a due date and initial milestone . This set of labels can serve to indicate externally that the issue is particularly important, as well as a reminder for internal teams of its importance. It is important to note that the customer and/or customer+ label does not constitute a promise for the issue to be delivered in any given milestone or time frame. GitLab is open-source, encouraging and promoting a large ecosystem of contributors is critical to our success. When making prioritization decisions, it’s important to heavily weight activities which will encourage a stronger community of contributors. Some of those activities are: Product managers are not responsible for prioritizing contributions outside of their group. These contributions should be reviewed and merged swiftly allowing everyone to contribute, including non-product teams at GitLab. The SaaS-First product investment theme will put us in a better position to support our customer base who is expected to accelerate adoption of SaaS products in the coming years. Features will also end up more secure, resilient, performant, and scalable for our self-managed customers if initially built to the expectations of SaaS. Therefore, it is important for PMs to understand and prioritize needs related to the SaaS business. When prioritizing SaaS related issues, we follow the same guidelines above . Within those guidelines there are a few areas that are especially important for PMs to focus on to ensure the success of our SaaS users. Downtime of GitLab.com has a material impact on our customers. From a 2014 report Gartner estimates that downtime costs companies on average “$5,600 per minute, which extrapolates to well over $300K per hour.” Furthermore, SaaS downtime can severely disrupt the productivity of GitLab Inc since we rely heavily on GitLab.com to run our business. Finally, downtime can also lead to customer churn and damage to our reputation. Thus, it is crucial as a company we collectively work towards consistently maintaining our 99.95% SLA on GitLab.com . There are a few things that PMs can do in partnership with their engineering team to help ensure overall Availability for GitLab.com. The infradev process is used to triage issues requiring priority attention in support of SaaS availability and reliability. As part of the broader effort to responsibly manage tech debt across the company, PMs should partner with their EMs to identify and incorporate infradev labeled issues of all severities . Note, issues labeled with a severity must be mitigated and resolved within specific time frames to meet the SLO. As EMs are the DRIs for prioritizing infradev work, PMs should familiarize themselves with the infradev process and Board . Other resources PMs can consult to identify and prioritize Infradev issues include: While not required, PMs are encouraged to listen in on Incident Management calls for incidents related to their product areas to 1) build empathy with the SRE team by gaining insight into how they handle incidents 2) gain a better sense of the impact of the incident to their customer base, and 3) identify improvements to their product areas, whether technical or feature-related, that could have prevented the incident. PMs are not expected to be in the decision-making path on actions taken to resolve the incident. They are there to listen and learn rather than attempting to decide/influence the course of resolution. After incidents involving their product area, PMs are also encouraged to engage in the Incident Review , including attendance at the Sync Incident Review call if their incident is scheduled. PMs can periodically review incidents via the Production Incident Board Enterprise customers interested in adopting SaaS may have common hard requirements to be able to use the product. For example, large enterprises may need certain security related features, such as Audit Logs, available before their security team will agree to the use of GitLab.com. This can also be about more than just features; it may include how and where we apply features so they can administrate their GitLab instance at enterprise-scale. For instance, permission management and shared configurations are best implemented top-down first instead of Project-up to meet the requirements of large organizations who may have 100s or 1000s of projects and only a small handful of people to perform these system-wide administrative tasks. In order to encourage more Enterprise adoption of GitLab.com, prioritize these common “hard-blockers” to adoption over “nice to have” features. PMs can use customer interviews to hone in on which issues are hard blockers to adopting SaaS vs more “nice to have” features that can be delivered later. To track hard adoption blockers, use the ~“GitLab.com Enterprise Readiness” label within the GitLab-Org and GitLab-com groups. There are a few special considerations when it comes to delivering features for SaaS. In order to achieve parity between SaaS and Self-managed installations PMs should prioritize efforts to eliminate existing feature gaps that exist across the two installations . Additionally, new features should ship for SaaS and self-managed at the same time. Features should be implemented at the group level first, before being implemented at the instance level, so that they will work across both self-managed and SaaS . Finally, in order for new features to be adequately monitored, they should include appropriate logging and observability , which makes troubleshooting much easier. As a product manager, you will be assigned as the stable counterpart to a single group . At GitLab we abide by unique, and extremely beneficial guidelines when interacting with our groups. These include: As an all-remote company, our crispness when it comes to responsibilities throughout the Product Delivery process was born out of necessity, but it pays untold dividends. Some of the benefits include: As described above, prioritization is a multi-faceted problem. In order to translate the priorities of any given group into action by our engineering teams, we need to be able to translate this multi-faceted problem into a flat list of priorities for at least the next release cycle. Product Managers are responsible for taking all these prioritization considerations and creating a clear, sequenced list of next priorities. This list should be represented as an issue board so that each team has a clear interface for making decisions about work. From this list, Product Designers, Engineering Managers and Product Managers can work together to determine what items will be selected for work in the immediate future. This does not mean that items will be addressed in strict order - Product Designers, EMs and PMs need to be cognizant of dependencies, available skill sets, and the rock/pebbles/sand problem of time management to make the best decisions about selecting work. Together with your Engineering Manager, you will have an important role in ensuring that the Build Plans defined for issues are created with iteration in mind. Iteration is highly valuable for the following reasons: As a company we emphasize velocity over predictability . As a product manager this means you focus on prioritizing, not scheduling issues. Your engineering stable counterparts are responsible for velocity and delivery. However, there are instances when there is desire for predictability, including: As the DRI for milestone prioritization , it is the Product Manager’s job to prioritize for predictability when it is needed. You should do so by ensuring you prioritize a deliverable, and its dependencies, so that it can reasonably be expected to be delivered by any committed dates. If there is time pressure to hit a date, the PM should also explore de-scoping the issue to meet the deadline, rather than pressuring engineering to move abnormally fast or cut corners. These information sources may be useful to help you prioritize. Individual product managers must consider, and advocate for global optimizations within the teams they are assigned to. If your assigned team requires expertise (remember everyone can contribute) outside the team you should make all reasonable efforts to proceed forward without the hard dependency while advocating within the product management team for increased prioritization of your now soft dependencies. Execution of a Global prioritization can take many forms. This is worked with both Product and Engineering Leadership engaged. Either party can activate a proposal in this area. The options available and when to use them are the following: We have found the following methods less successful in ensuring completion of work that warrants global prioritization: As a PM, you must plan for the near term milestones (more detailed) as well as for the long term strategy (more broad), and everything in between. While monthly milestone planning is done in GitLab, longer horizon planning (1-3 years) is done in direction pages. This will enable you to efficiently communicate both internally and externally how the team is planning to deliver on the product vision . Documenting a Section, Stage, Group and Category direction is critical to communicating where we are heading and why to all of our stakeholders. This is especially important to the members of your Product Group. Establishing a direction for stakeholders (including team members) to participate in, and contribute to ensures there is a concrete connection to “Why” we are iterating and how it furthers GitLab’s mission . Here are some of those connections: As a Product Manager you can highlight these connections in: Communicating this connection requires a multi-channel approach. We should strive to share and communication about the connection to our Direction warrants consistent reinforcement. Section leaders are responsible for maintaining Direction pages that lay out the strategy and plan for their respective section and stages. The direction pages should include topics outlined in this template . A category strategy is required which should outline various information about the category including overall strategy, status, what’s next, and the competitive landscape. The category strategy should be documented in a handbook page, which allows for version control of the category strategy as well as the ability to embed video assets. One of the most important pieces of information to include in the category strategy is a tangible next step or MVC and a clear description of focus and out-of-focus/maintenance areas. Your category strategies should contain short paragraphs with lots of references to specific epics and issues. Referencing topics, instead of features is encouraged as it’s more stable over time. We use this category strategy template as the outline for creating the handbook pages. If additional headings are needed you are empowered to create and populate them in your category strategy. You must keep these categories in sync with categories.yml and for new categories. Category direction should be reviewed on a regular basis (at least monthly) by the responsible product manager. To indicate the last time a category direction page was reviewed, please ensure pages include Content Last Reviewed: yyyy-mm-dd at the top of the category content. Update this date with every review, even if other content on the direction page has not changed. You should link to your category strategy from your stage strategy page. For categories that have already shipped, and that have a marketing product page, categories.yml should link to the product page. Inside of the categories.yml file there are dates assigned for either achieved or anticipated maturity achievement. These should be kept inline with communicated dates for achievement and updated as required. If the category has developed a UX Roadmap we recommend the product designer to create a merge request to incorporate UX Roadmap themes into the category direction page roadmap. Assign the MR to the PM for review and merge. In some cases there may be direction pages that span multiple stages or sections. A direction page that summarizes the collective vision as well as all the contributors of that direction is critical to maintain transparency and adequate assignment of ownership. There are several examples of these types of direction pages today: The steps for creating and managing a cross-section or stage direction are: Once the direction page has been added, there needs to be an assigned DRI for maintaining monthly updates for the page. It is the DRIs responsibility to ensure the shared direction page is regularly reviewed and is up to date. This requires cross-section / cross-stage collaboration from the DRI. You should use the ~direction label together with category and section labels to mark epics and issues that fall into the given direction. Product Direction items (i.e., with the label) should be direction-level items that move the strategy forward meaningfully. This is up to the PM to set the bar for, but there should be a clear step forward with real user value. It’s important to note here that your plan is not simply a list of new features and innovation. Those are included for sure, but so are issues related to all of your sensing mechanisms . A category upgrade from minimal to viable or delivery of a top customer issue (for example) can contribute to your plan just as much as a brilliant new innovative feature can. It’s up to PMs to balance this through a coherent longer-term strategy. Conversely, in a broad sense anything could move the plan forward in a general way. Finally, issues are the substance of your plan. Ensure you are applying the label to both revelant epics and its issues. As product managers, a core job is to set the correct expectations. We do this typically through discussing our direction and assigning issues to milestones. When you need to communicate specific dates, it’s recommended doing it with limited visibility internally or directly to the customers. When you need to communicate specific dates use calendar year (CY) dates . Fiscal year (FY) does not translate well outside the company. Accordingly, the direction pages are expected to refer to specific issues only for the next 3-4 months. Everything beyond that should discuss the topic, not specific issues. Creating a thoughtful direction for your section, stage, or category is a useful thought exercise that can help focus efforts, aid in prioritization, and get large groups of people on the same page. But beware of simply executing your long term plan. Our industry is incredibly dynamic, and we learn new things every day that can and should cause us to re-think our long term plans. We should ship what brings value to our customers, not what is easy to ship. Stay focused on creating value each and every milestone, and be quick to adjust your longer term direction as you learn more. For each category, we recommend tracking the improvements required to advance to the next level of maturity . You are welcome to track maturity plans either with ~maturity::... labels or maturity issues. Maturity plans are highly encouraged - but not required - for non-marketing categories. Product groups may choose to have OKRs . To use them effectively, you should have plans for the next three months in terms of driving specific product metrics through discovery and delivery actions. You should discuss the product metrics with your manager, your design and engineering counterparts and the actions to reach the results with your design and engineering counterparts. For each milestone, the planning quads come together to scope and plan work for the group for the upcoming milestone. Planning begins asynchronously with the creation of the planning issue. The planning issue is the SSOT for communication and all resources that are needed to plan a successful milestone. There are many ways to achieve to plan a milestone that should be curated based on the needs of the team. Below are a few examples of planning issues from groups acorss R&D to aid you in creating one that works best for your team. As you adapt your own issue, it is recommended you apply the label planning issue to aid in tracking and to incorporate our Product Principles into the process. Refer to the Product Development Timeline for details on how Product works with UX and Engineering to schedule and work on issues in upcoming releases. There are two non-exclusionary ways to plan and communicate work for future releases As a Product Manager you can maintain prioritization of your groups issues using a fully prioritized issue board where the ordering of the issues reflects their priority. Product Managers can assign milestones to issues to indicate when an issue is likely to be scheduled and worked on. Still, whether an issue can be delivered within a milestone is the decision of the engineering team. As we consider more distant milestones, the certainty of the scope of their assigned issues and their implementation timelines is increasingly vague. In particular, issues may be moved to another project, disassembled, or merged with other issues over time as they bounce between different milestones. The milestone of an issue can be changed at any moment. The current assigned milestone reflects the current planning, so if the plan changes, the milestone should be updated as soon as possible to reflect the changed plan. We make sure to do this ahead of starting work on a release. Capacity is discussed between the PMs and the engineering managers. There are helper labels to signals these plans like ~next::1-3 releases and its variants. In addition, we have two special milestones: Backlog and Awaiting further demand . Product Managers assign these issues to milestones that they have reviewed and make sense, but do not fit within the upcoming release milestones due to either a lack of comparative urgency or because we have not yet seen enough user demand to prioritize the item yet. The best way to demonstrate urgency on either of these items is to vote on them and, if possible, add comments explaining your use case and why this is important to you. Recommendation for when to change ‘Awaiting further demand’: Always focus on the overall value of the feature. Do you have a good understanding of the user problem? Do you have a good understanding of the impacted user base? Was the proposed solution validated? Issues with the ‘Awaiting further demand’ label often mean poorly understood requests that require more information from our users and the market. Often public feedback only comes from a small percentage of people using or evaluating a feature or product. You should always consider reaching out directly to our users to learn more about their use cases. Recommendation when changing a previously planned issue to Backlog : When moving a previously planned issue to Backlog , especially one planned for within the next release or two, consider the message that this may be sending to parties that were interested in this feature. In some cases, they may have been depending or planning upon the issue to be delivered around the assigned milestone, and with the change to Backlog that is now unlikely to occur. In these instances, it is best to concisely explain the rationale behind the change in a comment, so the community can understand and potentially respond with additional justification or context. It is also encouraged to move the issue to the Backlog as soon as it is clear that it will not be scheduled in the near future. This will help with understanding the change, as it will not seem like a last minute change. Communicating clearly changing priorities might encourage the community to contribute the issue to GitLab. Again, the milestone of an issue can be changed at any moment, including for both of these special milestones. From time to time, there may be circumstances that change the ability for a team to ship the features/issues they committed to at the beginning of the iteration. These steps also apply when an issue is broken into multiple issues. When this happens, as a PM you must coordinate with your EM counterpart that the impacted issues and their milestones are updated to reflect the new reality (for example, remove deliverable tag, update milestone , etc.). Additionally, notify your manager of the shift. Our design system provides the means to work autonomously, without always needing UX insight, feedback and design. When problems can be solved using an already documented paradigm, you don’t need to wait for UX approval to bring an issue to a reasonable state within a first iteration. If lingering questions remain, subsequent iterations can address any shortcomings the feature might have. Always consider that with a dedicated product designer, it’s much faster and cheaper to iterate on a design than to re-implement it. At the same time, not everything needs a design, and the design system is here to support your engineers and you in those cases. Iteration is a core value of GitLab, and product management has a central role to play in it. Iteration should be apparent as we deliver new features in MVCs, but it has implications for discovery too. As solution validation can move much faster than delivery, we should aim to validate features before building them. At this point, the feature validated is likely way bigger than an MVC if we would build it. We should pay special attention as product managers to still aim at iterative delivery after a bigger feature-set got validated, as delivered features provide the final validation. For example, once a direction is validated, we can start the delivery by documentation. As product managers we should aim to iterate as part of solution validation, and while delivering already validated solutions too. Here are several strategies for breaking features down into tiny changes that can be developed and released iteratively. This process will also help you critically evaluate if every facet of the design is actually necessary. As part of design and discovery, you likely created a minimal user journey that contains sequential steps a user is going to take to “use” the feature you are building. Each of these should be separated. You can further by asking yourself these questions: View, Create, Update, Remove and Delete are actions users take while interacting with software. These actions naturally provide lines along which you can split functionality into smaller features. By doing this, you prioritize the most important actions first. For example, users will likely need to be able to visually consume information before they can create, update, remove, or delete. Often, the criteria for features are built on is implicit. It can help to use a test-driven development mindset where you write the tests and the outcomes you need from the software before building the software. Writing these tests can uncover the different criteria you need the development team to meet when building the new feature. Once you’ve outlined these tests, you may be able to use them to continue to break down the feature into smaller parts for each test. Here are a few examples: Software often fails and can fail in different ways depending upon how it is architected. It is always best to provide the user with as much information as possible as to why something did not behave as expected. Creating and building different states to handle all possible errors and exceptions can easily be broken down into individual issues. Start by creating a generic error state to display when anything goes wrong, and then add on to handle different cases one by one. Remember to always make error messages useful , and add additional error messages as you identify new error states. Breaking down a design into pieces that can be released iteratively is going to depend on what you are building. Here are a few helpful questions to guide that process: Continuously improving the software we write is important. If we don’t proactively work through technical debt and Deferred UX as we progress, we will end up spending more time and moving slower in the long run. However, it is important to strike the right balance between technical debt, deferred UX, and iteratively developing features. Here are some questions to consider: For large projects, consider separating the announcement from the actual feature launch. By doing so, it can create more freedom to iterate during the customer rollout. For example, you could announce in advance to give customers ample notice, and then roll it out to new customers first, then to existing Free customers, then to existing paid customers. Or you could do the opposite, and roll it out to customers first, before announcing broadly, to ensure the user experience is great before making a marketing splash. When considering dates for a product announcement or launch that may impact our Field team, consider the blockout restrictions recognized by the Field team to ensure there won’t be any major disruption to the business near quarter end. Sometimes the objective is to cut over from one experience, or one system, to another. When doing so, consider having four transition phases rather than a hard cut over. The phases are: 1) experienced experience. 2) Run the experienced experience and new experience side-by-side, with the experienced experience the default, and the new experience is gradually rolled out to a subset of users. 3) Run them side-by-side, with the new experience the default for the majority, but the experienced experience is still available as a fallback in case of problems. 4) Deprecate the experienced experience and offer only the new experience. This strategy enables teams to have more flexibility and demonstrate more iteration in the rollout, with reduced risk. When something is important, it is natural to want to launch it all at once to get to the end game faster. However, big bang style launches tend to need everything perfect before they can happen, which takes longer. With iteration you get feedback about all the things that aren’t a problem and are done enough. It’s better to launch in small increments, with a tight feedback loop, so that the majority of users have a great experience. This tends to speed up the overall timeline, rather than slow it down. A Design Sprint , is a 5-day process used to answer critical business questions through design, prototyping and testing ideas with customers. This method allows us to reduce cycle time when coming up with a solution. As an all-remote company we run Remote Design Sprints (RDS) . Check out our guidelines for running an RDS to determine if it’s the right approach for the problem at hand. If you’re faced with a very large or complex problem, and it’s not clear how to most efficiently iterate towards the desired outcome, consider working with your engineers to build an experimental spike solution . This process is also sometimes referred to as a “technical evaluation.” When conducting a spike, the goal is write as little code within the shortest possible time frame to provide the level of information necessary the team needs to determine how to best proceed. At the end of the spike, code is usually discarded as the original goal was to learn, not build production-ready solutions. This process is particularly useful for major refactors and creating architecture blueprints . If the spike involves changes that will require approvals from other teams, consider engaging with relevant stakeholders and domain experts early to validate your approach. When launching a feature that could be controversial or in which you want to get the audience’s feedback, it is recommended to create a feedback issue. Here are some examples of feedback issues: Feedback issues are intended to collect feedback from the wider community and users. In some cases, internal user will be posting on behalf of users and customers. As a result we need to consider the following: Consider the following to improve iteration: Engaging directly with the community of users is an important part of a PM’s job. We encourage participation and active response alongside GitLab’s Developer Relations team . A general list of conferences the company is participating in can be found on our corporate marketing project. There are a few notable conferences that we would typically always send PMs to: If you’re interested in attending, check out the issue in the corporate marketing site and volunteer there, or reach out to your manager if you don’t see it listed yet. A stakeholder, or stable counterpart, is someone that is outside of your direct team who meets one or more of the following: Examples of stakeholders include Leadership, Sales, Marketing, Customer Support, and Customer Success. You may have stakeholders in any area of GitLab depending on your focus area and the specific issue. Stakeholders are also present outside of GitLab, for example, when a feature is being developed for a specific customer or set of customers. If you’re not sure who the stakeholder is to collaborate with or keep informed, visit product sections, stages, groups, and categories . Stakeholder collaboration and feedback is a critical competitive advantage here at GitLab. To ensure this is possible, and facilitate collaboration, you should maintain an updated single source of truth (SSOT) of your stage direction, category strategies, and plan, at all times. This equips anyone who wants to contribute to your stage’s product direction with the latest information in order to effectively collaborate. Some sections and teams use the scheduled Direction Update issue template to remind themselves of this task. Actively and regularly reach out to stakeholders. Encourage them to view and collaborate on these artifacts via these (non-exhaustive) opportunities: Here is some guidance for new PMs to ensure your stage direction, category strategies and plan are up-to-date and visible to critical stakeholders: It’s important to get direct feedback from our customers on things we’ve built, are building, or should be building. Some opportunities to do that will arise during sales support meetings . As a PM you should also have dedicated customer discovery meetings or continuous interviews with customers and prospects to better understand their pain points. As a PM you should facilitate opportunities for your engineering group to hear directly from customers too. Try to schedule customer meetings at times that are friendly to your group, invite them, and send them the recording and notes. If you’re looking for other ways to engage with customers here is a video on finding, preparing for, and navigating Customer Calls as a Product Manager at GitLab . Before the meeting , ensure the Sales lead on the account has provided you with sufficient background documentation to ensure a customer doesn’t have to repeat information they’ve already provided to GitLab. During the meeting , spend most of your time listening and obtaining information. It’s not your job to sell GitLab, but it should be obvious when it’s the time to give more information about our products. For message consistency purposes, utilize the Value Drivers framework when posing questions and soliciting information. Customer discovery meetings aren’t UX Research. Target them to broad-based needs and plan tradeoff discussions, not specific feature review. There are two primary techniques for targeting those topics: Follow the below guidance to prepare and conduct Customer Discovery Meetings: You can find some additional guidance on conducting Customer Discovery Meetings from these resources: PMs should also feel free to collect and evaluate customer feedback independently. Looking at existing research can yield helpful themes as well as potential customers to contact. You can use the following techniques to source customers directly: GitLab Solution Architects know our customers the best, especially from a technical perspective. GitLab Issues customers will often comments on issues, especially when the problem described by the issue is a problem they are experiencing firsthand. The best strategy is to capture their feedback directly on the issue, however, there are times when this is not possible or simply doesn’t happen. You can find alternative contact info by clicking on the user’s handle to see their GitLab user page; this page often includes contact information such as Twitter or LinkedIn. Another option is to directly mention users in issues to engage async. In popular issues you can just leave a general comment that you’re looking for people to interview and many will often volunteer. Customer Issues Prioritization Dashboards: The customer issues prioritization framework aggregates customer data with the issues and epics that they have requested. When viewing the dashboard , double click on the issue or epic of interest within the “priority score by noteable” table then scroll down to “QA Table - User request weighting by customer” to see the specific customers that are interested in the issue or epic. GitLab.com Broadcast Messages Broadcast Messaging is a great tool for acquiring customer feedback from within the product. You can leverage this workflow to use broadcast messaging. GitLab Sales and Customer Success You can ask for help in Slack customer success channel or join the Field Sales Team Call and the All CS Team Call to present a specific request via the Zoom call. Customer Success Managers (CSM) If a customer has a dedicated CSM, they may also have a regular meeting with a CSM. These meetings are a great opportunity to spend 15 minutes getting high-level feedback on an idea or problem. In Salesforce, CSMs are listed in the Customer Success section in the customer’s account information. CSMs are also very familiar with the feature requests submitted by their customers and can help identify customers that may be interested in the feature you are working on. Zendesk is a great tool to find users who are actively making use of a feature and either came across a question or an issue. Users who’ve had recent challenges using the product really appreciate PMs taking the time to learn from their experience. This establishes that we are willing to listen to users, even if they are not having a great experience. This is also a great opportunity to discuss the roadmap and provide context so that users understand what we are going to improve. The best way to request a chat is through the support ticket; however, you can also click on the user that initiated the interaction and their contact information will display on the left hand side panel. If you don’t have a Zendesk account, see how to request a light agent Zendesk account . You can use Zendesk’s trigger feature to receive email alerts when specific keywords relevant to your product area are mentioned in a support ticket. Additionally, it is possible to create a simple dashboard that lists all the currently active support tickets that match the trigger. Reach out in #support_escalations to receive some help in setting this up. Social Media can also be effective. If your personal account has a reasonable number of connections/followers, you can post your desire to connect with users on a specific question directly. When posting, remember to include the subject you want to discuss as well as how people can reach out. You can also reach out to the #social-media channel to have your tweet retweeted by the @gitlab account. If you want to reach a wider audience, consider asking a community advocate to re-post using the official GitLab account for the relevant platform. You can reach advocates on the #community-advocates Slack channel. You can also reach out to authors of articles related to tech your team is working on, via various publications such as Medium . A clear and brief email via the publication website or LinkedIn is a good way to engage. You’re able to request a LinkedIn Recruiter license . This Unfiltered video and slide deck provide an overview on how to use LinkedIn Recruiter to source participants for your study. If you’ve tried these tactics and are still having challenges getting the customer feedback you need, connect with your manager for support and then consider leveraging the UX Research team . Additionally, you can connect with Product Operations directly or by attending Product Operations Office Hours for troubleshooting support. Non-users are often more important than GitLab users. They can provide the necessary critical view to come up with ideas that might turn them into GitLab users in the end. The best non-users are the ones who don’t even plan on switching to GitLab. You can reach these people at local meetups, conferences or online groups like, Hacker News. In every such case, you should not try to interview the user on spot, instead organize a separate meeting where nobody will be distracted, and both of you can arrive prepared. One specific, recurring opportunity to get direct feedback from highly engaged customers is the GitLab DevOps Customer Advisory Board . You may be asked by the CAB to present your stage at these meetings. Here are some guidelines when doing so: You may be asked by the CAB to present your stage or a specific product offering at these meetings. Here are some guidelines for presenting: Product Focused Highlights: All presentation materials should be focused on products we plan to launch or evaluating products we have available to customers. Emphasize Dialogue over Monologue: Structure your presentation to encourage meaningful two-ways discussions. Prepare Targeted Questions: Develop 2-3 specific, through provoking questions to engage members in conversation. These questions should be focused on presentation, strategic decisions GitLab is currently grappling in your stage that you would like to gather customer feedback on, or a question related directly to customer workflows. Connect to Previous Feedback: Reference previous feedback you have received from advisory meetings in the past. This will help illustrate to CAB members the value of their time and that GitLab takes their recommendations into consideration. Prompt Follow Through: Document key insights and actions items during your session. Be Prepared: Be sure to prepare for the meeting ahead of time independently. Please review GitLab Product Customer Advisory Board Page for more details. When someone requests a particular feature, it is the duty of the PM to investigate and understand the need for this change. This means you focus on what is the problem that the proposed solution tries to solve. Doing this often allows you to find that: Do not take a feature request and just implement it. It is your job to find the underlying use case and address that in an elegant way that is orthogonal to existing functionality. This prevents us from building an overly complex application. Take this into consideration even when getting feedback or requests from colleagues. As a PM you are ultimately responsible for the quality of the solutions you ship, make sure they’re the (first iteration of the) best possible solution. When someone posts information in the #competition channel that warrants creating an issue and/or a change in features.yml , follow this procedure: You may want to interview a specific account because they are exhibiting atypical usage patterns or behaviors. In this case, request Support to contact GitLab.com user(s) on your behalf . If it is the weekend, and the contact request is urgent as a result of an action that might affect a users’ usage of GitLab, page the CMOC One of the primary artifacts of the validation track is the Opportunity Canvas. The Opportunity Canvas introduces a lean product management philosophy to the validation track by quickly iterating on level of confidence, hypotheses, and lessons learned as the document evolves. At completion, it serves as a concise set of knowledge which can be transferred to the relevant issues and epics to aid in understanding user pain, business value, the constraints to a particular problem statement and rationale for prioritization. Just as valuable as a validated Opportunity Canvas is an invalidated one. The tool is also useful for quickly invalidating ideas. A quickly invalidated problem is often more valuable than a slowly validated one. Please note that an opportunity canvas is not required for product functionality or problems that already have well-defined jobs to be done (JTBD) . For situations where we already have a strong understanding of the problem and its solution, it is appropriate to skip the opportunity canvas and proceed directly to solution validation. It might be worth using the opportunity canvas template for existing features in the product to test assumptions and current thinking, although not required. Reviewing opportunity canvases with leadership provides you with an opportunity to get early feedback and alignment on your ideas. To schedule a review: Opportunity Canvases are a great assessment for ill-defined or poorly understood problems our customers are experiencing that may result in net new features. As noted previously, opportunity canvases are helpful for existing features, except they are tailored for new feature development which is where the Product-Opportunity-Opportunity-Canvas-Lite issue template delivers. This template offers a lightweight approach to quickly identify the customer problem, business case, and feature plan in a convenient issue. The steps to use the template are outlined in the Instructions section and for clarity, one would create this issue template for an existing feature they are interested in expanding. For example, this template would be great to use if you are evaluating the opportunity to add a third or fourth iteration to an MVC. This issue should leverage already available resources and be used to collate details to then surface to leadership for review. Once you fill out the template, you will assign to the parties identified in the issue and you can always post in the #product channel for visibility. Part of being a product manager at GitLab is maintaining engagement with analysts, culminating in various analyst reports that are applicable to your stage. In order to ensure that this is successful and our products are rated correctly in the analyst scorecards, we follow a few guidelines: It’s important to be closely connected with your product marketing partner, since they own the overall engagement. That said, product has a key role to play and should be in the driver’s seat for putting your stage’s best foot forward in the responses/discussions. Product managers should take advantage of the internal customers that their stage may have, and use them to better understand what they are really using, what they need and what they think is important to have in order to replace other products and use GitLab for all their flows. We want to meet with our internal customers on a regular basis, setting up recurring calls (e.g., every two weeks) and to invite them to share their feedback. This is a mutual collaboration, so we also want to keep them up to date with the new features that we release, and help them to adopt all our own features. Each quarter, we reach out to User Satisfaction (USAT) survey responders who opted-in to speak with us. This is a fantastic opportunity to build bridges with end users and for Product Managers and Product Designers to get direct feedback for their specific product area. If a user has taken the time to share a verbatim with us and offered to have a conversation, they deserve to be followed up with - especially if that user is dissatisfied with GitLab. When we speak to users directly during this workflow, we must be mindful of Product Legal guidance and the SAFE framework , just as we would be with any other documentation or communication within Product. Note: GitLab Customer Success Managers can also follow the process above, so please be mindful to coordinate with them if they reach out or if they’ve already signed up to speak with a user. Users should never be contacted by more than one GitLab team member. Users should never be contacted more than twice if they do not respond to an outreach email. Hello, My name is X and I’m the Product Manager/Designer for X at GitLab. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to follow up on your response to our recent survey. I would be very interested in speaking further about some of the points you raised in your survey response. Would you be willing to do a 30 minute Zoom call to give us some more detailed feedback on your experience using GitLab? You’d be able to schedule the call at a time convenient to you. Schedule a time for the call using this link: https://calendly.com/yourname/30min Thank you for your feedback and let me know if you have any questions. Copy for three extra questions in Calendly invite : To make sure we correctly represent what you say in any followup issues or discussions, we would like to record this conversation. Please indicate if you give permission to record this conversation. Yes, you may record our conversation. No, you MAY NOT record our conversation. At GitLab, we value transparency. We would love to share the recording of conversation publicly on GitLab. Please indicate whether you give your permission for the recording to be shared on GitLab. Yes, you may share the recording publicly on GitLab. No, you MAY NOT share the recording publicly on GitLab. I agree that by participating in this, and any future, research activities with GitLab, GitLab B.V. will retain all intellectual property rights in any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, or other recommendations I provide which are hereby assigned to GitLab B.V. Note: It’s important to tag your USAT related issues to help tracking/reporting such as the improvement slides in Product Key Reviews. Every Product Manager is responsible for the user experience and cost profile of their product area regardless of how the application is hosted (self-managed or gitlab.com). If a feature is unsustainable from a cost standpoint, that can erode the margins of our SaaS business while driving up the total cost of ownership for self-managed customers. If a feature is slow, it can impact the satisfaction of our users and potentially others on the platform. There are a few questions a Product Manager should ask when thinking about their features: These items do not all need to be implemented in an MVC, though potential costs and application limits should be considered for deployment on GitLab.com. Product Managers should also regularly assess the performance and cost of features and experiences that they are incrementally improving. While the MVC of the feature may be efficient, a few iterations may increase the cost profile. There are a few different tools PM’s can utilize to understand the operational costs of their features. Some of these are maintained by Infrastructure, based on the operational data of GitLab.com. Others tools, like service ping, can be utilized to better understand the costs of our self-managed users. Ultimately, each product group is responsible for ensuring they have the data needed to understand and optimize costs. When performing the role of Life Support PM only the following are expected: Some discouraged responsibilities: As a Product Manager you may need to make a decision on whether GitLab should engineer a solution to a particular problem, or use off the shelf software to address the need. First, consider whether our users share a similar need and if it’s part of GitLab’s scope. If so, strongly consider building as a feature in GitLab : If the need is specific to GitLab, and will not be built into the product, consider a few guidelines: If after evaluating these considerations buying a commercial solution is the best path forward: When considering open source software in build vs. “buy” decisions we utilize the following general criteria to decide whether to integrate a piece of software: Please see Analytics Instrumentation Guide Goal: Increase product instrumentation across our offerings to deliver greater product insights. There is a need to retroactively evaluate what features have been instrumented and need instrumentation from past feature launches. Post launch implementation will allow us to gather insights and allow better visibility into feature usage + adoption that may not currently be captured. In order to better understand the perceived performance of GitLab, there is a synthetic page load performance testing framework available based on sitespeed.io . A Grafana dashboard is available for each stage, tracking the Largest Contentful Paint and first/last visual change times. These metrics together provide high-level insight into the experience our users have when interacting with these pages. The Grafana dashboards are managed using grafonnet , making it easy to add additional pages and charts. Testing a new set of pages requires just 2 steps: Assign both MR’s to a maintainer. After they are merged, the stage’s Grafana dashboard will be automatically updated. A video walkthrough is available as well."

    "title": "Product Development Flow",
    "paragraph": "GitLab’s product mission is to consistently create products and experiences that users love and value. To deliver on this mission, it’s important to have a clearly defined and repeatable flow for turning an idea into something that offers customer value. Note that it’s also important to allow open source contributions at any point in the process from the wider GitLab community - these won’t necessarily follow this process. This page is an evolving description of how we expect our cross-functional development teams to work, and reflects the current workflow being leveraged. All required actions or outcomes in this page are denoted as follows: Denotes a required aspect of the product development flow. Feature development is expected to pass through all phases to achieve specified outcomes, while the rest of the workflow should be considered as a set of best practices, tools, and recommendations. We realize there are unique cases in which certain product improvements may not need to flow through all the phases. We trust product managers to use their best judgement with alignment from their design and engineering team. The goal of this page is to support teams in their workflows by highlighting the necessary outcomes to target in each phase as well as sharing strategies/tactics, activities , teams can employ to achieve these outcomes. Additionally, this page aims to clarify the minimal set of required actions, such as labels, needed across all phases to keep the product system efficient in terms of tracking, searching and cross-functional collaboration. To maintain clarity and avoid confusion, we do not list optional actions on this page but teams may choose to employ additional actions, such as labels for planning, even if they are not mentioned on this page. As teams leverage the product development flow, they may find that certain strategies/tactics are serving their teams well toward success. Therefore, we welcome MRs to this page, so we can create a robust playbook of options to build valuable features for customers. All team members are encouraged to follow the change process for this page to share their best practices. No. Although the phases described on this page appear to be independent and linear, they are not. They’re presented in this way for simplicity and ease of navigation. At GitLab, we do not promote working in a linear manner. Phases in the product development lifecycle may overlap or occur in parallel. We aim to achieve key outcomes in each phase in order to de-risk subsequent phases. However, the product development flow doesn’t dictate the order we go through the phases, or the time spent in each. When teams have a high confidence in their direction, they should feel empowered to skip or shorten phases that won’t contribute to improved confidence. An engineering team conducts a technical review while other team members are performing Validation Phase activities. The team can then move to the Build phase rapidly with high confidence that their improvement is good for customers and technically feasible. A bug is reported by a GitLab customer. The Product Manager tests the bug and confirms its existence (Problem Validation). The team is extremely confident in the solution, so Design and Solution Validation are not needed. The bug is moved immediately to Build. Through the page, whenever a DRI is mentioned, the person referred to may be different depending on the phase, and there may be more than one. For who the DRI is, refer to the Product Development Roles and Responsibilities page . We use workflow labels to efficiently communicate an issue’s state. Using these labels enables collaboration across teams and communicates an issue’s current state. The workflow labels are prefixed with workflow:: , such as workflow::ready for development . The following diagram shows how a new issue moves to each workflow label, though states can be skipped when appropriate. The rest of this document describes each workflow step in detail. Issue descriptions shall always be maintained as the single source of truth. It’s not efficient for contributors to need to read every comment in an issue to understand the current state. Guidance on what and how to prioritize is covered in: For situations when the customer problem isn’t well understood , Product Managers (PMs) and the User Experience Department (UXers) should work together to validate new opportunities before moving to the Build track. The Validation track is an independent track from the always moving Build track. PMs and UXers should work together to get at least two months ahead, so that the Build track always has well-validated product opportunities ready to start. Milestone work should be prioritized with the understanding that some milestones may include more validation efforts than others. Validation cycles may not be necessary for things like bug fixes, well understood iterative improvements, minor design fixes, and technical debt. The types of activities and depth of research required in the validation track will depend on how well we understand the customer problem and solution. When: When our confidence about the proposed problem or solution isn’t high. For example, if we aren’t reasonably sure that the problem is important to a significant number of users, or that the solution is easy to understand and use. Who: Product Manager, Product Designer, UX Researcher, Product Design Manager, Engineering Manager Understand the user problem we are trying to solve. Identify business goals and key metrics to determine success. Generate hypotheses and research/experiment/user-test. Define MVC and potential future iterations. Minimize risks to value, usability, feasibility, and business viability with qualitative and quantitative analysis. Outcome: We have confidence that a proposed solution will positively impact one or more Product KPIs . There may be reason for exceptions, so the team would need to be clear in that case, and be able to justify that it’s still important without mapping back to our KPIs. If we don’t have confidence in the MVC or what success looks like, we should continue validation cycles before we move to the Build track. Label: workflow::validation backlog The growth of a world class product is built from a well maintained backlog. Product Managers are responsible for refining a group’s backlog to ensure validation opportunities are scoped and prioritized in line with category direction, stage, and/or section level strategy. The backlog is also the single source of truth for stakeholders to understand and engage with your group. An issue position in the backlog, along with the description, discussion, and metadata on those issues are key pieces of data necessary to keep stakeholders up to date. Label: workflow::problem validation To ensure the right solutions are delivered, the team must start their work with a validated problem . This can take many forms . If the problem is documented and well-understood, it may be possible to quickly move through this phase by documenting the known data about the user problem. A documented problem can be categorized as a pre-existing experience from feedback directly from users or an issue that has user engagement confirming that the problem is experienced by multiple users. A well-understood problem can be one that has a series of documented qualitative research from customer interviews, triangulating different sensing mechanisms confirming the problem, or using known data. Some examples of known data include Customer Request Issues or pre-existing Actionable Insights from prior research. To document that a problem is well-understood, link the known data and any customer calls to the relevant issues and epics. If the problem is nuanced or not yet well understood, then it will likely take longer to validate with users properly. This phase’s primary outcome is a clear understanding of the problem, along with a simple and clear way to communicate the problem to various stakeholders. Although optional, it is recommended to use an Opportunity Canvas as a tool that helps individuals better understand a problem, and communicate it to various stakeholders. An Opportunity Canvas can also be used to recommend creation of a new category including asking for new resourcing. After understanding and validating the problem, we can begin or continue to ideate potential solutions through a diverge/converge process. However, if the outcome from the problem validation phase confidently suggests an incremental modification to the existing solution, the aforementioned diverge/converge process could be skipped. This phase involves ideating potential solutions and exploring different approaches (diverge) before converging on a single solution. Solutions are evaluated by determining if they meet customer and business goals, are technically feasible, and align with legal compliance considerations. The team is encouraged to engage with stakeholders to determine potential flaws, missed use cases, potential security risks, and if the solution has the intended customer impact. THe DRI is responsible for reviewing the Legal Risk Checklist (accessible to team members only) and determining whether any sections need to be completed. After the team converges on the proposed solution or identifies a small set of options to validate, the issue moves into the Solution Validation phase. To start the Design phase, apply the workflow::design label to an existing issue or, if needed, creates a new issue with this label. Label: workflow::solution validation After identifying one or more potential solutions that meet business requirements and are technically feasible, the DRI must ensure that we have confidence that the proposed solution will meet the user’s needs and expectations. This confidence can be obtained from work performed during the design phase and supplemented with additional research (including user interviews, usability testing, or solution validation). If necessary, this phase will launch a Solution Validation issue within the GitLab UX Research project which will walk the team through research to validate their proposed solution(s). In addition, any non-functional requirements for the feature need to be considered and documented. These include such things as evaluating whether or not application limits need to be introduced, or any considerations around data storage should be evaluated. Defining these non-functional requirements up front ensures we are considering scalability and the long-term success of the feature. Sensible default values should be identified at this stage which align with the long-term vision for the feature. To start the Solution Validation phase, the DRI applies the workflow::solution validation label to an existing issue. The build track is where we plan, develop, and deliver value to our users by building MVCs , fixing defects, patching security vulnerabilities, enhancing user experience, and improving performance. This track is also a time when we get insight into whether we are creating the right thing for our users. The team works closely together to implement MVCs. Decisions are made quickly if challenges arise. We instrument usage and track product performance , so after MVCs are delivered to customers, feedback is captured quickly for learnings to refine the next iteration . For an example of how to leverage GitLab’s various features to create a focused and collaborative board to flow through the Build track, check out this video . When: As we build MVCs according to our product development timeline Who: Product Manager, Product Designer, Development team, Software Engineer in Test Release to a subset or full set of customers as appropriate. Assess UX, functional, technical performance, and customer impact. Collect data to measure MVC against success metrics to inform the next iteration. Iterate until success metrics are achieved and the product experience is optimal. Outcome: Deliver performant MVCs that improve one or more of our Product KPIs and/or Engineering KPIs . If it fails to do so, honor our Efficiency value (that includes a low level of shame), abandon it, and restart the validation cycle to identify the right solution. This phase prepares features so they are ready to be built by engineering. Bugs, technical debt, and other similar changes that are not features may enter the process in this phase (or may benefit from entering in earlier phases based on the cost of doing the work requiring the full problem to be validated to ensure it makes sense to do the work). Following Validation Phase 4 the feature should already be broken down into the quickest change possible to improve the user’s outcome and be ready for a more detailed review by engineering. During this phase, the DRI will surface issues they intend to prioritize for a milestone by applying the workflow::planning breakdown label. At this point, the appropriate DRI will assign an engineer to further break down and apply weights to that work. Tradeoff decisions can be made and feature issues evolve from validation solutions to clear MVCs that can be delivered in a single milestone. Be sure to document all decisions on issues. During this phase, the DRI must revisit the Legal Risk Checklist (accessible to team members only) to make sure none of their previous determinations during Validation phase 3: Design need revision. By reviewing and weighing work in the beginning of the Build Track, the DRI is able to make better prioritization tradeoffs and engineering teams can ensure they’ve scoped the right amount of work for the milestone. If an issue enters the workflow::planning breakdown state it doesn’t necessarily mean it will be prioritized in the next milestone, the DRI may make a tradeoff decision depending on capacity, and urgency. Once work has passed the workflow::planning breakdown step, the workflow::ready for development , type:: labels along with an upcoming milestone are applied to the issue. If an issue has been broken down, but not yet ready to pull into a milestone you may optionally apply the workflow::scheduling label; however, in this state any issue that has the workflow::ready for development label without a milestone has an implied status of “waiting to be scheduled”. The DRI will apply Deliverable label to issues with a milestone and marked workflow::ready for development signaling acceptance of the issue for that milestone. This process occurs at the beginning of milestone planning . During this phase, it’s important to keep Application Security Engineers informed to ensure that they have visibility into planning schedule. This provides them with sufficient time for planning dynamic testing so they can keep the product manager and development team informed of any time/resource requirements. The develop and test phase is where we build the features, address bugs or technical debt and test the solutions before launching them. The DRI is directly responsible for overall prioritization of a milestone, including bugs and maintenance work; however, the Engineering team is responsible for the implementation using the engineering workflow . Engineering owns the definition of done and issues are not moved into the next phase until those requirements are met. Keep in mind that many team members are likely to contribute to a single issue and collaboration is key. This phase begins after work has been broken down, and prioritized in Phase 1. Work is completed in priority order as set at the beginning of the milestone. The DRI will assign an issue to an engineer who is responsible for building the feature or addressing a bug or maintenance issue. An engineer can also self-serve and pick up the next priority order issue from the workflow::ready for development queue on their team’s board. That engineer will update its workflow:: label to indicate where it’s position in the development process . When an issue is in workflow::in review , the Application Security Engineer would help validate the risk mitigations through the non-blocking application security review process . Documentation for the work will be developed by the engineer and the Technical Writer (see Documentation with code as a workflow ). The Technical Writer should review the documentation as part of the development process. Items discovered during a documentation review should not block issues moving into the next phase. This may drive the creation of follow-on improvement MRs for the documentation, after release. After the feature code has been merged, the issue should be moved to workflow::verification . When an issue is in workflow::verification , the responsible engineer will manually test the feature in either the Staging or Production environment. Note: Work deemed out-of-scope or incomplete by engineering is taken back into the plan phase for refinement and rescheduling for completion. When the change becomes available in production and any needed verification is complete, the issue is closed and the workflow::complete label is added so stakeholders know work on it has been completed. Afterward, the DRI coordinates the release post and dogfooding process when they apply. After launch, the DRI should pay close attention to product usage data. This starts by ensuring your AMAU is instrumented and reporting as you expect. From there consider how the feature has impacted GMAU and SMAU . At this point you should also solicit customer feedback to guide follow-on iterative improvements, until success metrics are achieved/exceeded and a decision can be made that the product experience is sufficient. To create a combined and ongoing quantitative and qualitative feedback loop, consideration of the outcomes and potential activities below are recommended. Teams should release features as generally available from the start unless there are strong reasons to release them as experimental, beta, or limited availability first. Product development teams should refrain from making changes that they believe could create significant risks or friction for GitLab users or the platform, such as: In addition to the experiment details for users, experiments: All experimental features that meet the review criteria must initiate Production Readiness Review and complete the experiment section in the readiness template . In addition to the beta details for users, beta features: All beta features that meet the review criteria must complete all sections up to and including the beta section in the readiness template by following the Production Readiness Review process . Publicly available features must: In addition to the publicly available criteria above, GA features: Our mission is “everyone can contribute” , and that is only possible if people outside the company can try a feature. We get higher quality (more diverse) feedback if people from different organizations try something, so give users the ability to opt in to experimental features when there is enough value. Where possible, release an experimental feature externally instead of only testing internally or waiting for the feature to be in a beta state. We’ve learned that keeping features internal-only for extended periods of time slows us down unnecessarily. Experimental features are only shown when people/organizations opt in to experiments, so we are allowed to make mistakes here and literally experiment. To ensure the phases before general availability are as short as possible each phase of experiment, beta, and limited availability should include exit criteria. This encourages rapid iteration and reduces cycle time . GitLab Product Managers must take the following into account when deciding what exit criteria to apply to their experimental and beta features: For the exit criteria of AI features , in addition to the above, see the UX maturity requirements . All merge requests to this page require informing Product and Engineering Leadership (see page “maintainers” or codeowners). To make updates such as grammatical fixes and typos, you can have any approver review and merge."

    "title": "Engineering Workflow",
    "paragraph": "This document explains the workflow for anyone working with issues in GitLab Inc. For the workflow that applies to the wider community see the contributing guide . Products at GitLab are built using the GitLab Flow . We have specific rules around code review . In line with our values of short toes , making two-way-door decisions and bias for action , anyone can propose to revert a merge request. When deciding whether an MR should be reverted, the following should be true: Reverting merge requests that add non-functional changes and don’t remove any existing capabilities should be avoided in order to prevent designing by committee. The intent of a revert is never to place blame on the original author. Additionally, it is helpful to inform the original author so they can participate as a DRI on any necessary follow up actions. The pipeline::expedited label, and master:broken or master:foss-broken label must be set on merge requests that fix master to skip some non-essential jobs in order to speed up the MR pipelines. If you notice that pipelines for the master branch of GitLab or GitLab FOSS are failing, returning the build to a passing state takes priority over everything else development related, since everything we do while tests are broken may: A broken master is an event where a pipeline in master is failing. The cost to fix test failures increases exponentially as time passes due to merged results pipelines used. Auto-deploys, as well as monthly releases and security releases, depend on gitlab-org/gitlab master being green for tagging and merging of backports . Our aim should be to keep master free from failures, not to fix master only after it breaks. Any question or suggestion is welcome in the #g_development_analytics channel who owns the broken master automation proceess. There are two phases for fixing a broken master incident which have a target SLO to clarify the urgency. The resolution phase is dependent on the completion of the triage phase. Note: Recurring incidents are negatively impacting master pipeline stability and development velocity. Any untriaged, recurring incident will be automatically escalated to #dev-escalation following this timeline: If an incident becomes a blocker for MRs and deployments before being auto-escalated, the team member being impacted should refer to the broken master escalation steps to request help from the current engineer on-call as early as needed. Additional details about the phases are listed below. Recurring broken master incidents are automatically escalated to #dev-escalation unless it is triaged within 4 hours. If a broken master is blocking your team before auto-escalation (such as creating a security release) then you should: Note: Stable branch failures follow the same process as described here, but incidents are tracked in gitlab-org/release/tasks . See stable branches documentation for details. Master broken incidents must be manually escalated to #dev-escalation on weekends and holidays if necessary. Without a manual escalation, the service level objective can extend to the next working day; that is, triage DRI is expected to triage the incident on the next working day. Regardless of when the label was applied, we always consider an incident to be in an escalated state as long as it has the ~“escalation::escalated” label, until the incident is resolved. If a failed test can be traced to a group through its feature_category metadata, the broken master incident associated with that test will be automatically labeled with this group as the triage DRI through this line of code . In addition, Slack notifications will be posted to the group’s Slack channel to notify them about ongoing incidents. The triage DRI is responsible for monitoring, identifying, and communicating the incident. A notification will be sent to the attributed group’s Slack channel and #master-broken . Pipeline failures are sent to the triage DRI’s group channel, if one is identified, and will be reviewed by its group members. The failures will also be sent to #master-broken for extra communication. If an incident is announced in a DRI group’s Slack channel, the channel member should acknowledge it and assume the triage DRI responsibilities. If the incident is a duplicate of an existing incident, use the following quick actions to close the duplicate incident: If the incident is not a duplicate, and needs some investigation: Review non-resolved broken master incidents for the same failure. If the broken master is related to a test failure, search the spec file in the issue search to see if there’s a known failure::flaky-test issue. If this incident is due to non-flaky reasons , communicate in #development , #backend , and #frontend using the Slack Workflow. If you identified that master fails for a flaky reason , and it cannot be reliably reproduced (i.e. running the failing spec locally or retrying the failing job): Quarantine the failing test to restore pipeline stability within 30 minutes if the flakiness is continuously causing master pipeline incidents. Alternatively, if the failure does not seem disruptive, and you have a fix that you are confident with, submit the fix MR with the ~“master:broken” label to ensure your pipeline is expedited. If a flaky test issue already exists, add a comment in it with a link to the failed broken master incident and/or failed job. We have automation in place to create test failure issues automatically. The issue is named after the spec path, which can be a search keyword. If a flaky test issue doesn’t exist, create an issue from the New issue button in top-right of the failing job page (that will automatically add a link to the job in the issue), and apply the Broken Master - Flaky description template. Add the appropriate labels to the main incident: Add the stacktrace of the error to the incident (if it is not already posted by gitlab-bot), as well as Capybara screenshots if available in the job artifacts. Identify the merge request that introduced the failures. There are a few possible approaches to try: If you identified a merge request, assign the incident to its author if they are available at the moment. If they are not available, assign to the maintainer that approved/merged the MR. If none are available, mention the team Engineering Manager and seek assistance in the #development Slack channel. If no merge request was identified, ask for assistance in the #development Slack channel. Please set the appropriate ~master-broken:* label from the list below: If the triage DRI believes that there’s an easy resolution by either: The triage DRI can create a merge request, assign to any available maintainer, and ping the resolution DRI with a @username FYI message. Additionally, a message can be posted in #backend_maintainers or #frontend_maintainers to get a maintainer take a look at the fix ASAP. If the failures occur only in test-on-gdk jobs, it’s possible to stop those jobs from being added to new pipelines while the cause is being fixed. See the runbook for details. For an initial assessment of what might have contributed to the failure, we can try the experimental AI-assisted root cause analysis feature following this documentation . To confirm flakiness, you can use the @gitlab-bot retry_job <job_id> or the @gitlab-bot retry_pipeline <pipeline_id> command to retry the failed job(s), even if you are not a project maintainer. The merge request author of the change that broke master is the resolution DRI. In the event the merge request author is not available, the team of the merge request author will assume the resolution DRI responsibilities. If a DRI has not acknowledged or signaled working on a fix, any developer can take assume the resolution DRI responsibilities by assigning themselves to the incident. Once the resolution DRI announces that master is fixed: Merge requests can not be merged to master until the incident status is changed to Resolved . This is because we need to try hard to avoid introducing new failures, since it’s easy to lose confidence if it stays red for a long time. In the rare case where a merge request is urgent and must be merged immediately , team members can follow the process below to have a merge request merged during a broken master . Merging while master is broken can only be done for: First, ensure the latest pipeline has completed less than 2 hours ago (although it is likely to have failed due to gitlab-org/gitlab using merged results pipelines ). Next, make a request on Slack: A maintainer who sees a request to merge during a broken master must follow this process. Note, if any part of the process below disqualifies a merge request from being merged during a broken master then the maintainer must inform the requestor as to why in the merge request (and optionally in the Slack thread of the request). Next, ensure that all the following conditions are met: Next, add a comment to the merge request mentioning that the merge request will be merged during a broken master , and link to the broken master incident. For example: Next, merge the merge request: #master-broken-mirrors was created to remove duplicative notifications from the #master-broken channel which provides a space for Release Managers and the Developer Experience teams to monitor failures for the following projects: The #master-broken-mirrors channel is to be used to identify unique failures for those projects and flaky failures are not expected to be retried/reacted to in the same way as #master-broken . We run JiHu validation pipelines in some of the merge requests, and it can be broken at times. When this happens, check What to do when the validation pipeline failed for more details. To guarantee the readiness of any GitLab release, it is fundamental that failures on stable branches are addressed with priority, similar to master branch failures. It is the merge request author’s responsibility to backport the following to the maintained stable branches : Follow the engineering runbook to backport changes to stable branches. Security issues are managed and prioritized by the security team. If you are assigned to work on a security issue in a milestone, you need to follow the Security Release process . If you find a security issue in GitLab, create a confidential issue mentioning the relevant security and engineering managers, and post about it in #security . If you accidentally push security commits to gitlab-org/gitlab , we recommend that you: For more information on how the entire process works for security releases, see the documentation on security releases . A ~regression implies that a previously verified working functionality no longer works. Regressions are a subset of bugs. The ~regression label is used to imply that the defect caused the functionality to regress. The label tells us that something worked before and it needs extra attention from Engineering and Product Managers to schedule/reschedule. The regression label does not apply to bugs for new features for which functionality was never verified as working . These, by definition, are not regressions. A regression should always have the ~regression:xx.x label on it to designate when it was introduced. If it’s unclear when it was introduced, the latest released version should be added. Regressions should be considered high priority issues that should be solved as soon as possible, especially if they have severe impact on users. When identified in time, for example in a SaaS deployment, fixing them within the same milestone avoids their being included with that release. For better efficiency, it’s common for a regression to be fixed in an MR without an issue being created, either through reversion of the original MR or a code change. Regardless of whether there is an issue or not, the MR should also have the ~regression and ~regression:xx.x labels. This allows for trends to be accurately measured. Start working on an issue you’re assigned to. If you’re not assigned to any issue, find the issue with the highest priority and relevant label you can work on, and assign it to yourself. You can use this query, which sorts by priority for the started milestones , and filter by the label for your team. If you need to schedule something or prioritize it, apply the appropriate labels (see Scheduling issues ). If you are working on an issue that touches on areas outside of your expertise, be sure to mention someone in the other group(s) as soon as you start working on it. This allows others to give you early feedback, which should save you time in the long run. If you are working on an issue that requires access to specific features, systems, or groups, open an access request to obtain access on staging and production for testing your changes after they are merged. When you start working on an issue: You are responsible for the issues assigned to you. This means it has to ship with the milestone it’s associated with. If you are not able to do this, you have to communicate it early to your manager and other stakeholders (e.g. the product manager, other engineers working on dependent issues). In teams, the team is responsible for this (see Working in Teams ). If you are uncertain, err on the side of overcommunication. It’s always better to communicate doubts than to wait. You (and your team, if applicable) are responsible for: Once a release candidate has been deployed to the staging environment, please verify that your changes work as intended. We have seen issues where bugs did not appear in development but showed in production (e.g. due to CE-EE merge issues). Be sure to read general guidelines about issues and merge requests . Team members use labels to track issues throughout development. This gives visibility to other developers, product managers, and designers, so that they can adjust their plans during a monthly iteration. An issue should follow these stages: Workflow labels are described in our Development Documentation and Product Development Flow . For larger issues or issues that contain many different moving parts, you’ll be likely working in a team. This team will typically consist of a backend engineer , a frontend engineer , a Product Designer and a product manager . In the spirit of collaboration and efficiency , members of teams should feel free to discuss issues directly with one another while being respectful of others’ time . Avoid adding configuration values in the application settings or in gitlab.yml . Only add configuration if it is absolutely necessary. If you find yourself adding parameters to tune specific features, stop and consider how this can be avoided. Are the values really necessary? Could constants be used that work across the board? Could values be determined automatically? See Convention over Configuration for more discussion. Start working on things with the highest priority in the current milestone. The priority of items are defined under labels in the repository, but you are able to sort by priority. After sorting by priority, choose something that you’re able to tackle and falls under your responsibility. That means that if you’re a frontend developer, you work on something with the label frontend . To filter very precisely, you could filter all issues for: Use this link to quickly set the above parameters . You’ll still need to filter by the label for your own team. If you’re in doubt about what to work on, ask your lead. They will be able to tell you. It’s every developers’ responsibilities to triage and review code contributed by the rest of the community, and work with them to get it ready for production. Merge requests from the rest of the community should be labeled with the Community contribution label. When evaluating a merge request from the community, please ensure that a relevant PM is aware of the pending MR by mentioning them. This should be to be part of your daily routine. For instance, every morning you could triage new merge requests from the rest of the community that are not yet labeled Community contribution and either review them or ask a relevant person to review it. Make sure to follow our Code Review Guidelines . GitLab.com is a very large instance of GitLab Enterprise Edition. It runs release candidates for new releases, and sees a lot of issues because of the amount of traffic it gets. There are several internal tools available for developers at GitLab to get data about what’s happening in the production system: There is extensive monitoring publicly available for GitLab.com. For more on this and related tools, see the monitoring handbook . GitLab Inc has to be selective in working on particular issues. We have a limited capacity to work on new things. Therefore, we have to schedule issues carefully. Product Managers are responsible for scheduling all issues in their respective product areas , including features, bugs, and tech debt. Product managers alone determine the prioritization , but others are encouraged to influence the PMs decisions. The UX Lead and Engineering Leads are responsible for allocating people making sure things are done on time. Product Managers are not responsible for these activities, they are not project managers. Direction issues are the big, prioritized new features for each release. They are limited to a small number per release so that we have plenty of capacity to work on other important issues, bug fixes, etc. If you want to schedule an issue with the Seeking community contributions label, please remove the label first. Any scheduled issue should have a team label assigned, and at least one type label. To request scheduling an issue, ask the responsible product manager We have many more requests for great features than we have capacity to work on. There is a good chance we’ll not be able to work on something. Make sure the appropriate labels (such as customer ) are applied so every issue is given the priority it deserves. Teams (Product, UX, Development, Quality) continually work on issues according to their respective workflows. There is no specified process whereby a particular person should be working on a set of issues in a given time period. However, there are specific deadlines that should inform team workflows and prioritization. With the monthly release date being the third Thursday of the release month, the code cut-off is the Friday prior. The next milestone begins the Saturday after code cut-off. All other important dates for a milestone are relative to the release date: Refer to release post content reviews for additional deadlines. Note that deployments to GitLab.com are more frequent than monthly major/minor releases. See auto deploy transition guidance for details. At the beginning of each release, we have a kickoff meeting, publicly livestreamed to YouTube. In the call, the Product Development team (PMs, Product Designers, and Engineers) communicate with the rest of the organization which issues are in scope for the upcoming release. The call is structured by product area with each PM leading their part of the call. The Product Kickoff page is updated each month, which follows the content on the livestream. Engineering Managers are responsible for capacity planning and scheduling for their respective teams with guidance from their counterpart Product Managers. To ensure hygiene across Engineering, we run scheduled pipelines to move unfinished work (open issues and merge requests) with the expired milestone to the next milestone, and label ~\"missed:x.y\" for the expired milestone. Additionally, label ~\"missed-deliverable\" whenever ~\"Deliverable\" is presented. This is currently implemented as part of our automated triage operations . Additionally, issues with the ~Deliverable label which have a milestone beyond current +1, will have the ~Deliverable label removed. We keep the milestone open for 3 months after it’s expired, based on the release and maintenance policy . The milestone cleanup is currently applied to the following groups and projects : Milestones closure is in the remit of the Delivery team . At any point in time a release might need to be created for an active milestone,and once that is no longer the case, the Delivery team closes the milestone. The milestone cleanup will happen on the milestone due date. These actions will be applied to open issues: Milestones are closed when the Delivery team no longer needs to create a backport release for a specific milestone. When working in GitLab (and in particular, the GitLab.org group), use group labels and group milestones as much as you can. It is easier to plan issues and merge requests at the group level, and exposes ideas across projects more naturally. If you have a project label, you can promote it to a group milestone. This will merge all project labels with the same name into the one group label. The same is true for promoting group milestones. We definitely don’t want our technical debt to grow faster than our code base. To prevent this from happening we should consider not only the impact of the technical debt but also consider the impacts spreading like a contagion. How big and how fast is this problem going to be over time? Is it likely a bad piece of code will be copy-pasted for a future feature? In the end, the amount of resources available is always less than amount of technical debt to address. As we innovate our platform, we will have situations where a strategic decision will be made to incur technical debt in order to preserve a higher feature velocity to meet market and customer demand. This accrual of technical debt presents risks due to the long-term implications for the usability, security, reliability, scalability, accessibility, and/or availability of our product and platform. Therefore technical debt may be accrued but must be: If it is to be deferred by more than 6 months, it should be considered for the product and engineering roadmap. Technical debt issues you wish to be closed must not affect the “*abilities” and have a justification included on why it cannot be remediated within the next 18 months (meaning, there is an action plan on the Engineering roadmap). To help with prioritization and decision-making process here, we recommend thinking about contagion as an interest rate of the technical debt. There is a great comment from the internet about it: You wouldn’t pay off your $50k student loan before first paying off your $5k credit card and it’s because of the high interest rate. The best debt to pay off first is one that has the highest loan payment to recurring payment reduction ratio, i.e. the one that reduces your overall debt payments the most, and that is usually the loan with the highest interest rate. Technical debt is prioritized like other technical decisions in product groups by product management . For technical debt which might span, or fall in gaps between groups they should be brought up for a globally optimized prioritization in retrospectives or directly with the appropriate member of the Product Leadership team . Additional avenues for addressing technical debt outside of product groups are Strategic Priority Codes and working groups . Sometimes there is an intentional decision to deviate from the agreed-upon MVC , which sacrifices the user experience. When this occurs, the Product Designer creates a follow-up issue and labels it Deferred UX to address the UX gap in subsequent releases. For the same reasons as technical debt, we don’t want Deferred UX to grow faster than our code base. These issues are prioritized like other technical decisions in product groups by product management . As with technical debt , Deferred UX should be brought up for globally optimized prioritization in retrospectives or directly with the appropriate member of the Product Leadership team . UI polish issues are visual improvements to the existing user interface, touching mainly aesthetic aspects of the UI that are guided by Pajamas foundations. UI polish issues generally capture improvements related to color, typography, iconography, and spacing. We apply the UI polish label to these issues. UI polish issues don’t introduce functionality or behavior changes to a feature. Open merge requests sometimes become idle (not updated by a human in more than a month). Once a month, engineering managers will receive an Merge requests requiring attention triage issue that includes all (non-WIP/Draft) MRs for their group and use it to determine if any action should be taken (such as nudging the author/reviewer/maintainer). This assists in getting merge requests merged in a reasonable amount of time which we track with the Open MR Review Time (OMRT) and Open MR Age (OMA) performance indicators. Open merge requests may also have other properties that indicate that the engineering manager should research them and potentially take action to improve efficiency. One key property is the number of threads, which, when high, may indicate a need to update the plan for the MR or that a synchronous discussion should be considered. Another property is the number of pipelines, which, when high, may indicate a need to revisit the plan for the MR. These metrics are not yet included in an automatically created a triage issue. Security is our top priority. Our Security Team is raising the bar on security every day to protect users’ data and make GitLab a safe place for everyone to contribute. There are many lines of code, and Security Teams need to scale. That means shifting security left in the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) . Each team has an Application Security Stable Counterpart who can help you, and you can find more secure development help in the #sec-appsec Slack channel. Being able to start the security review process earlier in the software development lifecycle means we will catch vulnerabilities earlier, and mitigate identified vulnerabilities before the code is merged. You should know when and how to proactively seek an Application Security Review . You should also be familiar with our Secure Coding Guidelines . We are fixing the obvious security issues before every merge, and therefore, scaling the security review process. Our workflow includes a check and validation by the reviewers of every merge request, thereby enabling developers to act on identified vulnerabilities before merging. As part of that process, developers are also encouraged to reach out to the Security Team to discuss the issue at that stage, rather than later on, when mitigating vulnerabilities becomes more expensive. After all, security is everyone’s job. See also our Security Paradigm . From time to time, there are occasions that engineering team must act quickly in response to urgent issues. This section describes how the engineering team handles certain kinds of such issues. Not everything is urgent. See below for a non-exclusive list of things that are in-scope and not in-scope. As always, use your experience and judgment, and communicate with others. A bi-weekly performance refinement session is held by the Development and QE teams jointly to raise awareness and foster wider collaboration about high-impact performance issues. A high impact issue has a direct measurable impact on GitLab.com service levels or error budgets . The Performance Refinement issue board is reviewed in this refinement exercise. The infradev process is established to identify issues requiring priority attention in support of SaaS availability and reliability. These escalations are intended to primarily be asyncronous as timely triage and attention is required. In addition to primary management through the Issues, any gaps, concerns, or critical triage is handled in the SaaS Availability weekly standup . The infradev issue board is the primary focus of this process. (To be completed primarily by Development Engineering Management) Issues are nominated to the board through the inclusion of the label infradev and will appear on the infradev board . Issues with ~infradev ~severity::1 ~priority::1 ~production request labels applied require immediate resolution. ~infradev issues requiring a ~“breaking change” should not exist. If a current ~infradev issue requires a breaking change then it should split into two issues. The first issue should be the immediate ~infradev work that can be done under current SLOs. The second issue should be ~“breaking change” work that needs to be completed at the next major release in accordance with deprecation guidance . Agreement from development DRI as well as the infrastructure DRI should be documented on the issue. Infradev issues are also shown in the monthly Error Budget Report . Triage of infradev Issues is desired to occur asynchronously. These points below with endure that your infradev issues gain maximum traction."

    "title": "Data For Product Managers",
    "paragraph": "This page is intended to help Product Managers at GitLab understand what data is available to them and how they can use it to understand how their product is used. This page primarily covers two topics: how to consume data, and what data is available. The user-facing end of GitLab’s data stack consists of our BI Tool, Tableau, which is connected to our Snowflake data warehouse. The Tableau handbook page of the Data team handbook has general information about Tableau aimed for a wider GitLab audience. Here are some useful links that we recommend for you to bookmark: In order to gain access to Tableau, you will need to follow the instructions here and open an access request. Published data Tableau sources are great ways to allow Tableau users to build charts without writing any SQL or modeling. The Data team has created several Published Data Sources in Tableau that have the official “Certified” badge. For example, Mart Ping Instance can be used to look at Service Ping ping-level details. The Data team uses a tool called dbt for our data transformation layer. A nice feature of dbt is dbt docs, which automatically creates documentation for all of the models in our schema. Our dbt docs instance can be found here . You will need to locate the file you wish to update or create in the gitlab-data analytics project . Please be sure to read and follow the SQL style guide when creating the changes. If you wish to update only the descriptions or information about tables you will be looking for a schema.yml file. If you wish to actually change the structure of tables it will be a *.sql file. Next, create a branch and then submit an MR using the dbt Model Changes template to the gitlab-data analytics project . When creating your branch and MR please follow the Data team workflow and use the appropriate Data team labels . If you ever get stuck or have a question, please ask for help in the #data slack channel . It is recommended to also cross-post questions in your #g_, #s_, or #product channels because many PMs have data related expertise and can provide you quick assistance for common product data questions. If needed, you may create an issue in the Product Data Insights project and assign it to a product data analyst . You can read more about working with the PDI team here . As a GitLab PM, you’re responsible for defining and tracking metrics for your team’s features. This guide will walk you through the process, tools, and resources available to help you succeed. If your analytics needs for your new or recently modified feature are met by these dashboards, you can skip creating a Product Data Insights (PDI) Issue: Plan Your Analytics Requirements Option A: Use the CLI Generator to generate requirements for your Instrumentation Issue Option B: Use Usage Data Instrumentation Issue Template to outline metric requirements When instrumenting features routed through the AI Gateway, follow these guidelines: Represent new features routed through the AI Gateway as unit primitives Set up tracking for the new unit primitive By following this process and understanding the roles involved, PMs can effectively instrument and track metrics for their features, enabling data-driven decision-making and product improvement. We have three primary data sources for product usage data: Each data source comes with its own caveats, capabilities, and limitations. The first question we on the Data or PDI teams ask product managers is usually “are you interested in knowing this for Self-Managed or GitLab.com?” Our approach to answering your question and the data source(s) available differ greatly between the two. Although our Self-Managed offering has many more active customers, our GitLab.com offering has much more granular data available to analyze. Service Ping is a custom tool that GitLab built to collect weekly aggregated information from our customers across various deployment options: Here is an example of a query that provides ping-level details, filters out GitLab.com, and limits to the last ping of the month: Here is an example of a query that provides metric-level reporting by month and deployment type: Because GitLab.com is a GitLab instance hosted by GitLab, we have access to the instance’s postgres database and can load parts of it into our Snowflake data warehouse. This means we can get a very detailed look into how our product is used on GitLab.com. Our ELT process works by explicitly stating which columns and tables we want to import into the data warehouse. This means we might be missing a column or whole table that you want to have in the data warehouse for analysis. When this is the case, please create a Data issue letting us know what you want us to import using the New Data Source template . Before doing so, please confirm that the table/column is truly part of the production schema . Here is an example of a query that will generate GitLab.com UMAU by day: Here is an example of a query that will generate paid GitLab.com GMAU by month: Snowplow Analytics is an open-source enterprise event-level analytics platform that enables data collection from multiple platforms for advanced data analysis. Analytics Instrumentation has built Internal Event tracking , which will guide you on how to instrument Snowplow events. To get started, use the Quick Start Guide to Internal Event Tracking . Once your Snowplow events have been instrumented, as part of the validation process, the newly instrumented event should be tested to ensure it is working properly. While you as the PM probably won’t be doing the validation yourself every time, it is nice to know how it works. You can learn more about testing Snowplow events in the Internal Event documentation here . The data you have instrumented is most useful if it can be visualized in a chart. Refer to the Tableau section of the handbook for information on creating charts. The Snowplow models are quite large and can be slow to query. To make your query faster, use a date ( behavior_at ) filter in your WHERE statement. Here is an example of a query that will look at the top 100 Snowplow events from the last several days: Here is an example of a query that will look at top 100 pages viewed in the last several days (note how the URLs are pseudonymized): Analytics Instrumentation is part of the product org and is completely separate from the Data and Product Data Insights teams. However, these teams collaborate closely as the Customer Product Adoption pod."

    "title": "Pricing model",
    "paragraph": "GitLab’s pricing strategy is set by the CEO. Everyone can contribute, and the best way to communicate is on the #pricing Slack channel. Contributions are part of the day-to-day jobs of the following people: Most of GitLab functionality is and will be available for free in our Free tier. Our paid tiers include features that are more relevant for managers, directors, and executives . We promise all major features in our scope are available in Free too. Instead of charging for specific parts of our scope (CI, Monitoring, etc.) we charge for smaller features that you are more likely to need if you use GitLab with a lot of users. There are a couple of reasons for this: Because we have a great free product we can’t have one price. Setting it high would make the difference from the free version too high. Setting it low would make it hard to run a sustainable business. There is no middle ground that would work out with one price. That is why we have Premium and Ultimate tiers . The price difference between them is half an order of magnitude (5x). We will charge per user, per application, or per instance. We do include free minutes with our subscriptions and trials to make it easier for users to get started. As we look towards more deployment-related functionality on SaaS it’s tempting to offer compute and charge a percent on top of, for example, Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We don’t want to charge an ambiguous margin on top of another provider since this limits user choice and is not transparent. So we will always let you BYOK (bring your own Kubernetes) and never lock you into our infrastructure to charge you an opaque premium on those costs. As a commercial organization, we always want to grow the number of paying customers, therefore we are focused on increasing the free to paid conversion rate. However, GitLab offers a free product, and our free users bring tremendous value to the company beyond just the likelihood of converting to a paid customer one day. Our pricing philosophy is aligned with our GitLab Values . We take a value-based pricing approach at GitLab. The core of the value-based pricing is to understand the value proposition that our innovations provide to our current and future customers for that offering. We aim to price our offerings to achieve continued growth and financial success for both the customer and GitLab. To understand the value that we deliver to our customers, we focus on the benefits that our customers can receive to achieve their business goals. The value to our customers can include: Defining and quantifying the value being delivered does not happen in isolation. We regularly engage with customers to understand how our solutions help them. These engagements are important as they will provide insights on how our innovations are valued by the customers and how it impacts our customers’ willingness to pay. Willingness to pay is a crucial element when we decide on how to price and packaging our offerings. We understand that customers have choices when they decide to make a purchase. Hence, understanding the competitive landscape of our products is very critical. With respect to competition, we focus on the key differences between our value proposition and the competition’s value proposition. Our pricing aims to reflect the differential value that we provide. We aim to design the pricing structure that works best for our customers compared to our competitors inclusive of pricing metric. To following our pricing philosophy, we aim to support long-lasting customer relationships. When we develop our pricing, the target is that both our customers and GitLab become successful together. For long term success, where we can run a sustainable business and meet our company’s financial goals, we do also consider cost to serve and margins as factors when pricing is determined. It is important to note that while costs and margins are factors in pricing, value provided to our customers is the foundational element. Pricing affects Product, Marketing, and Sales. Therefore, general pricing decisions are made by the CEO. Product makes most decisions on a day-to-day basis about what feature should go in what plan based on the paid tiers . The following table describes how large cross-functional pricing decisions should be made. This decision making method differs from our normal RADCIE method due to the extremely cross-functional nature and business risk of large pricing decisions. To ensure alignment across stakeholders, a monthly Pricing Steering Committee is held to align on upcoming monetization decisions, discuss historical insights/trends, and prioritize areas of opportunity. We have three pricing tiers. How we make decisions on a day-to-day basis is specified on our stewardship page . When considering buyers as part of product tiering decisions we use the following guidance: When the tiering of a feature is being evaluated, the stewardship promise will override this guidance. Understanding the distinction of our buyer-based model can be difficult. In it we focus not on the user of the feature, but on the buyer and in what cases a feature would be useful to that buyer even in cases where the buyer is not the user. When making these decisions we ask questions like: Below we list product categories and the current and proposed features which reside in a given tier to highlight how the buyer-based model works in practice. While our tiers are based on who leads the purchasing decision there are occasions where driving increased usage takes precedence over the natural buyer-based tiering, always in favor of moving features to lower tiers. Here’s why: As GitLab develops new categories that are likely to be in paid tiers, it is still reasonable (and in many cases advisable) to get the early MVC versions to land in the free or lower paid-tier to spur adoption, encourage contributions and gain feedback from the wider user base. Over time, the team can then add more features on top of the MVC functionality that will be placed in the paid-tiers. However, Product Managers should not move features down in violation of the buyer-based model unless there is a concrete high confidence plan to follow up with meaningful additions to the base feature that can be added to and monetized with the right paid tier When considering tiering, if the feature is geared to be used (not purchased) by individuals and the answer to the question of who cares most about this feature? is today - very few people we should consider open-sourcing it to get more usage and contributors. Regardless of the reasoning behind the down-tiering of a feature, the process should still be followed. If a feature in the free tier (typically useful to ICs, but also to others) will open up the possibility to circumvent or abuse our tiering policy, we should exercise extreme caution and err on the side of maintaining the feature in a paid tier. An example of this is repo pull mirroring that is useful for ICs and can also be great for adoption (i.e. trying out GitLab.). However, it may also lead to larger instances in Free tier mirroring to smaller instances in paid tiers to make use of paid-tiered features. This goes against our pricing terms & conditions and therefore we chose to keep the feature in a paid tier instead of Free tier. When building integrations to partners it is possible to make exceptions to our buyer-based model when our tiers don’t align well with those of the partner, but only in favor of lower tiers. As an example - a partner who provides a team collaboration tool with a free tier might desire any GitLab integration to be present in our free tier despite it clearly being appropriate for single team usage. The go-to-market benefits of this partnership can outweigh the divergence from our buyer-based model. We’ve found that bundling our features within tiers into themes resulted in improved conversion performance on our pricing page . While it is how we present the value of our tiers, this themes-based representation serves as an additive filter for, and is not a replace of, our Buyer Based Tiering decision. Themes are then bundled into customer value drivers . The following are our current set of capabilities: 10,000 compute minutes per month 50,000 compute minutes per month Because themes are filters for our Buyer Based tiers, there can occasionally be instances where a feature’s tier and its natural theme don’t match. In that case we should either: Note - it is OK for the features of a theme to be in the listed tier and any lower tier. Our higher tier is still the best option for our customers: There are multiple reasons why our lower tiers have more relative value: Arguments in favor of raising the price of the lower tier (which we won’t necessarily do) are: Please note that all the above is not a plea to add more or fewer features to lower tiers, we should just follow our Buyer Based Open Core model . We use the same names for SaaS and Self-Managed tiers because: There is a big price difference between the different tiers (0$, $29, custom per user per month, a price difference of infinite, 5x). For GitLab Inc., the majority of revenue comes from large enterprises buying the top two tiers. Most companies in a similar situation would focus only on the highest tiers. But we want to make a our hybrid model work for the following reasons: A 5x higher price doesn’t mean there is 5x more value, just like the Premium tier doesn’t provide infinitely more value than the gratis Free tier. When deciding between tiers, organizations should look at the ratio between how much extra value they get divided by how much extra they pay. If this ratio is comfortably above 1, it makes sense to move to a higher tier. The value is in making people more effective, saving time on integrating tools, driving faster time to value, and retiring other tools. This should more than pay for the increased price of a tier. An analogy would be Apple’s iPhone: it is twice as expensive as an average Android phone, and while it doesn’t deliver twice as much value, the extra value is worth the extra cost. As Stripe documented : hybrid is hard, because “The most common result of attempting both models simultaneously is that only one of the models receives any traction, and (because these models weave themselves into all operations of the company) it typically strangles the other.” This hybrid models is how we bridge the chasm between self-service and enterprise. We tried selling one feature at a time, but this was not feasible. An improved version of that would be selling 7 main features, instead of 3 plans. Examples of main features would be: High Availability, Security, Service Desk, etc. We currently think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. We believe having a single plan for one customer works because the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. For the GitLab sales team and for GitLab customers, we suggest handling the objection by focusing on the value and business outcomes As our customers adopt GitLab as the single application for their entire DevOps lifecycle, we are hearing more and more non-developer use cases using GitLab for Agile project management. The main functionality that some non-developer roles need aligns fairly well with our reporter permission access, including Managing Labels, Assigning Issues, and Creating and Editing Epics, etc. Those users don’t really need to use much other developer functionality. Currently, we do not offer a different list price for users who only need the reporter permission because: We understand that our customers have non-developer use cases. Please contact our sales team or connect with us via this issue to discuss your specific use cases. Arguments to charge more for SaaS: Arguments to at least make them equal: Not sure what is normal in the market. Adobe did a good job, but they moved from perpetual licensing to subscriptions, where it is hard to compare the two prices . This is the title of a great article of which we’ll apply the 8 points to GitLab below: Annual, up-front pricing is currently our only offering. All internal systems should show only annual pricing to keep comparisons simple. We do show monthly pricing externally. Arguments supporting annual up-front pricing: Arguments supporting also offering monthly pricing: Almost all SaaS products show monthly pricing on their pricing pages. GitLab shows monthly pricing on our website and notes clearly that it is billed annually. This is also a standard practice followed by companies like Salesforce . We previously have tried showing annual pricing on the website, but repeatedly heard from customers that they were confused by it. They often thought our product was priced significantly higher than it actually was because they expected the pricing to be displayed in monthly units and read the annual price as though it were per month. Most companies evolve in the following way: An example is Microsoft Office, where it is costly to buy components of Office365 separately, although higher tiers include more products. At GitLab, we decided to skip the intermediate steps and immediately only offer a suite that includes all our products. Having our complete scope included in our open source version is even part of our stewardship promises . Selling only a suite has risks, after the => is how we mitigate those at GitLab: Companies evolve to selling only a suite for the following reasons, after the => is how this applies to GitLab: We’re going even further than selling a suite by integrating everything in a single application. We do that because of the advantages mentioned on our handbook page about us being single application . A secondary effect is that the user doesn’t have to make a buying, or even an adoption, decision. Charging one price that incorporate all our stages is the perfect bundle . There are two factors that determine how much value GitLab creates for an organization, in order of importance: When an organization is larger, the benefits of GitLab are larger because: Since GitLab is an open core project, we’ll always create much more value then we (are able to) capture. Based on the value created, the straightforward way to capture value would be to: These straightforward ways are not possible for the following reasons: So we’re left with charging for features. We can’t charge for each feature separately, since that is unwieldy for the customer. So we charge for tiers that contain a bundle of features. We select features in the (more expensive) paid tiers that: Adding features to a (more expensive) paid tier is not the only thing stopping users from adopting them, but it is a very important factor. To simplify the above, we base our feature groupings on champion position (see below). We make feature tiering decisions based on: “Who cares most about the feature” . Our three tiers are differentiated based on the buyer persona or IC who buys GitLab, from individual contributor, to manager/director, to executive. Every person in the company is on the same tier , even if they don’t use all the features. The feature is put in the plan based on what champion is most likely to care about it. Buyers make sense, since a higher-cost plan needs a higher-placed buyer. More detail about this in Sid’s presentations about Buyer-Based-Open-Core at the Open Source Leadership Summit in 2019 and at Heavybit . Also, see fork and commoditize (internal) in our list of concerns. A customer asked why merge request approvals were not included in free: Thanks for asking. We think that managers are more likely to care about merge requests approvals than individual contributors. That doesn’t mean that individual contributors don’t care about them. And it doesn’t mean that in all cases managers care more, just in most cases. For more information please see our Buyer Based Open Core model: #buyer-based-open-core . We should not hesitate to open source features. When we put a feature into too high of a tier we should move it quickly because not having it in all tiers limits who can use the feature and this hurts: In most cases the following guidelines apply: Below is a video with the CEO discussing the philosophy of this with a Product Manager: When in doubt, we will default to moving features to a lower tier, moving it down quickly if data shows that this is more appropriate. Not all tier changes will involve moving things to lower-priced plans and paid features may move into the higher tier, but open source features should never move to paid tiers . Occasionally, a feature may unintentionally become available at a lower-tier due to a bug. This can include the free (open source) tier. When we fix the bug and return the feature to the correct tier, this is not the same as moving an open source feature to a paid tier. The definitive source for a given feature’s tier is our documentation . We should focus on building new features that buyers want and making sure that the initial assessment of new features is never too low. While we reserve the ability to move features up in tier, proving the necessity has a much higher bar since we are constraining the existing reach of a feature rather than expanding it. Please also note that the CEO is in charge of pricing and tiers; this is delegated to product for the day-to-day work. While other parts of the GitLab organization are consulted, the CEO is the directly responsible individual . To propose a change that impacts pricing or changes a feature’s tier (e.g. moving a feature from Premium to Free), please follow the process outlined in the Feature Tier or Pricing Change issue template . What is interesting is that GitLab creates more value as you adopt more of it. This shouldn’t be confused with DevOps maturity. DevOps maturity is how advanced your practices are and how fast your DevOps lifecycle is, shown in cycle analytics . With the best practices embedded in GitLab, you will mature faster than without it. GitLab enables a 200% faster DevOps lifecycle. But DevOps maturity is mostly about organizational change. GitLab the product is just an enabler of it. Even if an organization uses everything of GitLab (high DevOps score), they can still have a slow process (slow lifecycle). We know there is a correlation between a higher DevOps score and a faster lifecycle; but especially in organizations new to DevOps, it is a trend, not an absolute. Linking our tiers to maturity would mean we don’t ask any money from the large organizations that currently have a slow lifecycle but that are making it faster by adopting all of GitLab. These large organizations with a slow lifecycle benefit the most from GitLab, since they can adopt it completely, because they are not held back by an existing toolchain. As suggested by a user on X (X login required). This is a good suggestion to consider given the GitLab approach to adapting to local markets throughout the business. GitLab will assess viability of the idea in our overall pricing strategy planning. It is difficult to do and our assessment of this will consider:"

Our goal is to make our product easy to use, supportive of contributions from the wider GitLab community, and built for a diverse global community. We want GitLab to be the easiest and most delightful product in its class. We work closely with the community, and our stable counterparts Product Managers (PM), Frontend engineers (FE), Backend engineers (BE), Quality engineers, and the Brand team. We follow GitLab’s shared process referred to as the Product Development Flow and R&D Interlock . Every Product Designer is aligned with a PM and is responsible for the same customer benefits the PM oversees. Technical Writers each support multiple stage groups. UX Researchers support multiple groups within a section. In the spirit of having stable counterparts, we plan headcount as follows: To request a new product/service, open an issue using the UX procurement proposal issue template . Your manager will work with UX Leadership to identify spending needs and partner with FP&A to secure budget before following the vendor lifecycle . GitLab uses labels to categorize, prioritize, and track work. The following is a breakdown of the labels most directly related to the UX workflow. An overview of all the label types and uses can be found in the contributing doc . UX label : Indicates that UX work is required on this issue. These issues can be new features, ideas for improvement or anything else where UX should contribute their expertise. Inclusion label : A change to GitLab that promotes inclusion as it relates to our diversity value. Inclusive design label : Considering, exploring, and evaluating the different ways someone would access, interact with, or contribute to content that results in a more accessible experience. Accessibility and scoped accessibility labels are used to identify issues with accessibility impact. The scoped labels should be added after an accessibility audit has validated the impact and used in combination with priority and severity labels to triage an issue. learnability label : Issues that address learnability problems by helping users quickly become familiar with GitLab features. Scoped workflow labels from the Product Development Flow should be used to indicate where an issue is in the development lifecycle. Issues can move between workflow labels as many times as necessary, and not all labels will be applicable to every issue. Issues that require UX would use one of these labels as defined in the Product Development Flow: Pajamas component lifecycle labels are scoped labels used for creating and updating Pajamas components. Label usage guidelines can be found in the Pajamas component lifecycle documentation . UX problem validation label : Indicates that the issue requires UX work to validate that the problem is relevant to users. We use this label in addition to the Product Development Flow scoped labels, so that we can track validation efforts over time in our UX Performance Indicators . UX solution validation label : Indicates that the issue requires tasks to validate that the proposed solution is technically feasible and meets user needs. We use this label in addition to the Product Development Flow scoped labels, so that we can track validation efforts over time in our UX Performance Indicators . UI polish label : Indicates the issue covers only visual improvement(s) to the existing user interface. Deferred UX label : Deferred UX results from the intentional decision to deviate from the UX vision or MVC, which sacrifices the user experience. Deferred UX labeled issues are to be included in subsequent releases. Use this label to indicate that the UX released does not meet: This label is applied to any follow-up issues that address a UX gap. It does not apply to the issue or merge request that created the Deferred UX. For example, if the agreed MVC design solution is not fully realized due to release pressures or implementation oversight, that’s considered Deferred UX. If the design is implemented correctly but unforeseen UX issues are identified, it is not considered Deferred UX. If in doubt about when to apply this label, use the following rule: If you can say “This UX problem did not originate from an issue or merge request,” then it’s just UX, not Deferred UX. In case your team makes the decision ship an MVC that contains Deferred UX, it is recommended to create an issue to track it as soon as the change has been released. Learn more about Deferred UX as a UX Department Performance Indicator . Seeking community contributions System Usability Scale (SUS) labels : Indicates that the issue is related to usability problems surfaced in one of our SUS research efforts. More specifically, issues related to SUS that are prioritized can be labeled with the corresponding Fiscal Year and Quarter. For example: SUS::FY22 Q2 - Incomplete . Learn more about SUS score as a UX Department Performance Indicator Regression label : Indicates a bug introduced in the latest release that broke correct behavior (see the contribution guidelines for more info). UX scorecard label : Indicates the primary issue or epic for the UX Scorecard . We use this label to help us easily find current work and track efforts over time. UX scorecard-rec label : Indicates this issue is a recommendation that was a result of a UX scorecard review. It’s OK if the issue was created prior to the scorecard being done; it can still be pulled into the set of recommendations. CM scorecard label : Indicates the primary issue or epic for the CM Scorecard . It is used to easily find current work and track efforts. cm-scorecard-rec label : Indicates this issue is a recommendation that was a result of a CM Scorecard. Actionable Insights document learnings from research that need to be acted on. Type labels : Used to track feature, maintenance, and bug issues and MRs. UX Leadership are active participants in influencing the prioritization of all three work types. See also who are the DRIs for prioritization . Theme labels can be created to group issues that solve a similar user experience problem but don’t have a category. This can be especially useful for a user experience that spans the product. These issues still require a UX label. UX: Feature Discovery Improvement : Indicates issue may improve feature discoverability. UX: Onboarding Improvement : Indicates issue is a potential onboarding improvement. The UX Calendar ( internal only ) is the SSOT for our team meetings. You can find the details for UX calls, UX Forum, and other team meetings here. These meetings are open to everyone in GitLab. Anyone in the UX department can add events to the Google Calendar. Managers and above can make changes and manage sharing, while ICs can make changes to events. Please reach out in the #ux_leadership Slack channel with any questions or requests. The UX All Hands meeting takes place every six weeks, with two sessions to accommodate both EMEA/AMER and APAC/AMER-friendly time zones. The purpose is to share company updates, stay connected, and receive feedback. The entire UX department is invited, though anyone at GitLab is welcome to attend and contribute to the All Hands agenda (internal). As with all general meetings at GitLab, attendance is optional though encouraged, and will be recorded. To understand the specific challenges faced by the UX Department, we hold an async UX retrospective after every milestone. This retro is carried out through a new Issue created for the recent release in the ux-retrospectives project. The goal is to evaluate what went well, what didn’t go well, and how we can improve. The UX Forum is a recurring meeting for UX team members to share and discuss their work. This includes past, current, or future work, and covers Product Design, UX Research, and Technical Writing. All meetings are recorded and made available on Unfiltered for Product, UX, Engineering, and Leadership to watch at their convenience. In UX, we utilize performance factor worksheets ( internal only ) as a way to facilitate talent assessment and growth conversations between manager and their direct reports. These worksheets are available in Google Sheets format and the spreadsheets include tabs for a mid-year and year-end review, as well as a tab to list Achievement, Strengths, and Opportunities throughout the year. It is strongly encouraged for each team member to have their own worksheet created at the start of the fiscal year so that it can be used as a tool throughout the entire year. Performance factor worksheets can be utilized to help efficiently complete the year-end company talent assessment program within Workday ."

    "title": "Legal, Employment at GitLab: A Strategic Partnership",
    "paragraph": "Employment law governs the relationship between employers and employees. At GitLab, the Legal Employment team serves as a strategic partner across the organization, providing expert guidance and proactive legal solutions throughout the entire team member lifecycle. What does this partnership entail? We * collaborate strategically with Sales, Go-to-Market, Finance and People teams to develop scalable, compliant employment solutions as GitLab expands globally and responsibly, implementing a comprehensive process for gathering, assessing, and acting on country-specific information. We empower the Talent Acquisition department to achieve its critical goals while ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations during sourcing, recruitment, and hiring processes. We enable the People Operations team to effectively onboard and support team members with location- and role-specific legal support, setting team members up for success from day one. We partner with the Total Rewards team, People Operations team and People Business Partners to develop forward-thinking policies that balance GitLab’s business objectives, team members’ needs, and global legal requirements. We provide strategic counsel to our Team Member Relations team, People Business Partners, and Total Rewards as they navigate complex team member matters, including reasonable accommodation requests, performance management, career progression, and other relationship dynamics. We champion our Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging initiatives by aligning all employment decisions with our mission statement and applicable laws. We safeguard GitLab’s interests while also providing fair treatment during employment transitions, including offboarding processes and post-employment matters. To work with the Legal Employment team, reach out early in your process, provide complete information about your needs and any time constraints you have. Being specific about what you’re requesting and any deadlines you face will enable the Legal Employment team to best triage requests and support you. To connect with Legal Employment, especially on sensitive matters, you can use the ’ legal-employment@gitlab.com ’ email address, or for non-sensitive queries, you can reach out in the #legal slack channel. Note that GitLab team members with individual employment queries should reach out to Team Member Relations team on ’ teammemberrelations@gitlab.com ’ or to their aligned People Business Partner for support. For cross-functional projects that do not involve individual team members but do require the Legal Employment team’s attention, please (i) open an Issue in the Legal and Compliance Project ; (ii) select the appropriate Issue Template; (iii) apply the label legal-employment :: to-do and (iv) if you know which Legal team member you will be working with, include them as an Assignee. This will update the Legal Employment Issue Board for the Employment team’s benefit, and allow the team to pick up and/or assign appropriately. A table showing coverage for queries by subject matter is available for internal use and can be accessed here . You are welcome to consult any member of the Legal Employment team. It is worth considering the privilege guidelines when communicating with GitLab’s Legal and Corporate Affairs team (aka the LACA team), including the Legal Employment team. Note that, if a communication is privileged, it can be protected from disclosure in litigation or other disputes. If in doubt, there’s an internal, GitLab University micro course on ‘Privileged communication’ , which is relevant to any team member who communicates with the LACA team, seeking legal advice on behalf of GitLab. The training explains the legal protection which may be applied to certain communications between team members and LACA and how best to communicate in order to be protected. It is also important to note that, if you receive any formal documents that appear to be legal notices, demands, subpoenas, court papers, or other potential litigation materials, you should please forward these by email to the legal team immediately (to the ’ legal@gitlab.com ’ email address) without responding yourself. Please add a brief note explaining when and how you received the document. These materials often have strict response deadlines, and your prompt sharing allows the legal team to review and address them properly to protect both you and GitLab."

    "title": "Sustainability",
    "paragraph": "Corporate Sustainability is a business approach that enhances long term stakeholder value by implementing a strategy that considers every dimension of how a business operates when making social, environmental and economic progress. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance and refers to the three key factors when measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment in a business or company. At GitLab we use Sustainability and ESG interchangeably. Both terms are relevant to our work and both serve different purposes depending on the audience we interact with. The Sustainability Team creates and maintains GitLab’s Corporate Sustainability strategy and programs by driving and integrating responsible business practices and ESG regulatory compliance. The Sustainability team builds and maintains strong internal and external relationships to understand stakeholder expectations - including customer, investor and team members. This engagement allows us to remain customer centric and easy to do business with while meeting shareholder and team member expectations. The Sustainability Team has two primary functions and four corresponding programs: Compliance & Reporting : Manages customer and prospect ESG-related questionnaires, requests for proposals, and sustainability contractual clauses. Leads annual Sustainability report and external assurance process. Monitors global ESG regulation and works cross-functionally to advance GitLab’s culture of compliance with applicable ESG regulations. Responds to investor ESG rating agencies to maintain competitive ESG scoring among peers. Climate Action : Identifies and executes strategic climate programs, including annual measurement of GitLab’s greenhouse gas inventory, emissions reduction target-setting, partners with Procurement to run the sustainable supplier program, identifies emissions reduction opportunities across the business, and purchases high quality carbon credits. Manages team member & customer communications related to GitLab’s commitment to environmental sustainability. GiveLab : GiveLab is GitLab’s team member volunteer program and includes year-round volunteering, GiveLab 30 days of Impact, our annual company-wide volunteer campaign and GiveLab Champions Program. Volunteerism is an effective way to build trust through social connections - this leads to higher individual and team motivation, and greater cross-functional collaboration. GitLab for Non-Profits : GitLab’s in-kind donation program. Manages social impact communications with team members and customers, while developing strategic nonprofit partnerships to advance GitLab’s ESG goals and help enhance our brand reputation by demonstrating our commitment to the nonprofit community. Deeply integrated into our business philosophy, GitLab’s Sustainability strategy is driven by our values of Collaboration, Results for Customers, Efficiency, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, Iteration, and Transparency (CREDIT). GitLab’s stakeholders, including customers, investors, team members, and community members play a key role in GitLab’s Sustainability strategy. GitLab conducted its inaugural ESG materiality assessment in 2022. By conducting a materiality assessment with our stakeholders, we identified which ESG topics have the greatest impact on GitLab’s business and where we have the potential to have the greatest impact on the environment, society, and our global communities - those material topics drive the programs, policies and initiatives under our strategy. This page will continue to be updated as we make progress towards developing plans and programs to advance our Sustainability goals. The purpose of the advisory committee is to create cross-functional alignment on ESG objectives and decision making, to go beyond simply compliance and into long-term operational implementation. Members of the Sustainability Advisory Committee Like all functions at GitLab, transparency is a core focus. Every year GitLab publishes an annual sustainability report where we share our approach to managing our key sustainability focus areas, provide updates on programs and policies, achievements to date, metrics and targets, and plans for the future. The Sustainability team works cross-functionally to prepare GitLab for compliance with ESG regulations. The Sustainability team also supports internal teams with customer ESG questionnaires and RFPs. Customers and prospective customers are increasingly asking about GitLab’s Sustainability programs, including questions related to GitLab’s climate commitments and greenhouse gas emissions. Many of our customers are also subject to ESG regulation and we expect customer ESG questions to continue to increase as they look to better align to new regulations. GitLab is committed to doing our part to minimize our environmental footprint, including working to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our operations. GitLab’s stakeholders, including customers, investors, regulators, and team members expect the company to operate sustainably and to do our part to reduce our environmental footprint. Many of GitLab’s customers have GHG reduction targets and as a vendor, GitLab’s carbon emissions contribute to our customers’ emissions footprints. To remain easy to transact with, GitLab needs to meet the expectations of our customers by taking action on climate change. GitLab’s Climate Action Program consists of four pillars: Measure & Report: Every year GitLab conducts an annual greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory in alignment with the GHG Protocol, the global best practice carbon accounting standard. We publish the results of the inventory in our annual ESG report and have the data assured by a third-party. In 2026, GitLab is subject to new regulations in the US and the EU that will make these disclosures mandatory. Act: GitLab is taking action to reduce our carbon emissions. As a fully remote software company, the majority of our emissions come from our suppliers. Engaging our suppliers to measure their carbon emissions and set their own reduction targets is a critical component of our reduction pathway, which is why we have set an aspirational supplier engagement target. Please see the Sustainable Procurement Program for more information. The Sustainability team continues to explore other ways to reduce emissions and is doing further analysis on additional reduction pathways. Engage: This includes engaging GitLab team members in climate education and action. In 2024, we launched the GitLab Team Member Sustainability Guide , providing actionable steps team members can take at home to minimize their environmental impact. In FY26, we launched our partnership with Mammoth Climate , a climate literacy and challenges platform, to further engage team members with educational materials, activities, and rewards Accelerate: While GitLab works to reduce our emissions, we are also committed to accelerating climate solutions by purchasing high quality carbon credits to cover a portion of our carbon footprint. We are proud to partner with Rubicon Carbon to purchase a diversified portfolio of high quality carbon credits, financing carbon removal projects that meet Rubicon’s high standards of quality . In FY25, GitLab set an aspirational science-aligned supplier engagement target to reduce our Scope 3 emissions: 70% of our suppliers (by emissions) will have science-aligned climate targets by FY29. Our sustainable procurement program includes the following initiatives: We look forward to sharing updates on this new initiative. The Green DevOps Working Group at GitLab aims to embed sustainability throughout the software development lifecycle to reduce environmental impact while unlocking operational and business value. Its core objectives include lowering carbon emissions and energy use, integrating green practices into business processes, enhancing customer capabilities to meet regulatory and sustainability goals, and positioning GitLab as a leader in sustainable DevOps and green software. Workstreams address areas such as cloud sustainability, CI/CD energy consumption tracking and reduction, community innovation and engagement, sustainable AI and procurement, and reporting. Each workstream is led by the Sustainability team and the relevant functional team member. Customers who are interested in providing insights and feedback on sustainability features are encouraged to contact the Sustainability Team at esg@gitlab.com for more information. At GitLab, all team members do work that supports the company, which supports the enhancement of an open source codebase. This codebase is freely available to everyone to make better software faster and drive progress through what they build. Between 2022 and 2024, team members made over 125,000 commits to the open source part of the GitLab codebase. But, there are also other ways to give back and many team members choose to contribute beyond GitLab. In addition to contributing to GitLab, GitLab offers additional optional pathways for team members to give back while leveraging their unique skills and passions through programs such as GiveLab, GitLab’s Team Member Volunteer Program. GitLab encourages team members to take part in volunteer initiatives such as supporting their local communities, participating in virtual volunteer activities, and organizing volunteer activities as part of team events. Corporate volunteerism has been proven to be an effective strategy for boosting engagement , improving employee retention, and strengthening relationships at work . Volunteering with GiveLab supports team members in fostering connections, building trust among one another and embodying our CREDIT values while positively impacting our communities. Team members may self organize volunteer events at any point throughout the year. To submit a request for a team volunteer activity with a Registered Nonprofit Organization that isn’t on the current GiveLab Nonprofit Directory , please go to the Philanthropic Requests epic and open a new issue using the Volunteer_Support Template . Team members can also request support from the Sustainability Team to organize local or virtual volunteer opportunities on their behalf by going to the Philanthropic Requests epic and opening a new issue using the Volunteer_Support Template . Please write “yes” for the question, “Would you like the Sustainability team’s help organizing the volunteer activity?” All team members and volunteer activities must adhere to the GitLab Philanthropy Policy . Team members must follow GitLab’s paid time off (PTO) policy if volunteering during work hours and use the “public service/volunteer” option in Workday. If volunteering in person, team members may incur some expenses. Team members can expense up to a total of $25 per volunteer event for expenses incurred that meet the allowed for reimbursement criteria. All expenses should be submitted in Navan using the “GiveLab” classification. Please note that GitLab does not allow team members to travel to in-person volunteer events. All in-person volunteering should be local to the team member. As with all company expenses , team members must be thoughtful in spending the company’s money and use best judgment to ensure that all expenses are deemed “ordinary and necessary.” Team members should follow all team member expense responsibilities . Expenses allowed for reimbursement (for in-person volunteer events): Expenses not allowed for reimbursement: As with our unique ways of working, GitLab and its team members have identified and sought out opportunities for impact that speak not only to our values but also to our all-remote nature. To review previous opportunities that team members participated in, visit the historical activities page . GiveLab 30 Days of Impact is GitLab’s annual volunteer campaign created to encourage team members to foster connections, build trust among one another and embody our CREDIT values while positively impacting our communities. We have designed this program with our high-performing team culture and results for customers in mind. GiveLab 30 days of Impact runs annually in Q4 and our goal is to encourage as many team members as possible to volunteer over the course of 30 days. The information on GiveLab 30 Days of Impact 2025 can be found on the internal Loop page . Throughout the month, team members can volunteer as little as one hour of their time to make an impact. We understand that our team members are driven by many different factors, and we welcome that volunteer participation will look different for everyone. Through GiveLab 30 days of Impact we aim to offer many different ways for team members to get involved such as: While GitLab encourages year-round volunteerism through GiveLab , GiveLab 30 days of Impact centralizes our efforts into an annual campaign to have a larger collective impact over a specific timeframe. Corporate volunteerism has been proven to be an effective strategy for boosting engagement , improving employee retention, and strengthening relationships at work . Additionally, this program offers volunteering opportunities around a major holiday season in many parts of the world, a time when many are seeking opportunities to give back. Team member participation is voluntary, should not interfere with work commitments, and time off is required to be in alignment with GitLab’s PTO policy . Travel is not permitted for this program. Team Members may choose to volunteer virtually or through local in-person events. Volunteer events typically last between one and four hours. Managers play an important role in supporting team members in taking time for themselves and their families, while also ensuring accountability to results and coverage for teams and its goals. Our Results for Customers value sits at the top of our values hierarchy, and our PTO policy empowers managers to appropriately manage workloads and deliverables, while also giving team members the time away they need from work. Team Members taking time off to volunteer should communicate time off in advance with their manager. To request volunteer time off, follow the Paid Time Off procedures outlined in our handbook and reach out to People Operations via HelpLab should you have any concerns. A step-by-step guide on how to request paid time off can be found here . Note that volunteer time off should be used towards acceptable volunteer activities and in adherence with our GitLab Philanthropy Policy . Please see our GiveLab reimbursement policy to understand current allowances as they relate to volunteering costs. We have created an internal GiveLab Volunteer Directory that features a list of vetted nonprofit organizations with available volunteer opportunities. Team members can search the document for virtual volunteer opportunities, opportunities to volunteer with GitLab Foundation grantees and search for local opportunities. We encourage all team members to contribute to our GiveLab Volunteer Directory. To recommend a nonprofit organization to add to the Directory, please open a Volunteer Recommendation Issue . The GiveLab Champions are team members who are passionate about giving back to their communities and want to encourage other team members to do the same. GiveLab Champions self-identify to participate in the voluntary Champions group, managed by the Sustainability team. The GiveLab Champions help activate the GiveLab signature program, but also work to organize and promote volunteer opportunities year-round. GiveLab Champions help team members build trust through social connections, build connections within their communities, and help GitLab provide meaningful opportunities for team members to give back. The GiveLab Champions ensure global voices are heard and relevant causes are represented based on where team members live. GiveLab Champions help to make GitLab a better place to work. The time commitment for a GiveLab Champion is estimated to be 3-5 hours per quarter. Participation can vary throughout the year. GitLab launched GitLab for Nonprofits , an in-kind donation program in 2023. Through this program, GitLab supports Registered 501c3 (or jurisdictional equivalent) Nonprofit Organizations in good standing that align with our values by offering free licenses and seats. The program operates on a first come first served basis. Once the annual donation of 5,000 seats is met, the application will remain closed for the year. What are the benefits of the GitLab for Nonprofits program? GitLab is a single platform for project management, collaboration, source control management, git, automation, security, and much more. Because it is easy to use, flexible, and all in one place, it is the best choice for nonprofits to scale their work. The GitLab for Nonprofits Program gives free licenses of GitLab to registered nonprofit organizations. Nonprofits accepted into the program will be provided a free Ultimate license for one year (SaaS or self-managed) for up to 20 seats. Additional seats may be requested although they may not be granted. Who qualifies for the program? GitLab supports Registered 501c3 (or jurisdictional equivalent) Nonprofit Organizations in good standing that align with our Values . A “Registered Nonprofit Organization” is one that has been registered with the local government or authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal or national government. For the calendar year 2024, we will limit the in-kind program to 5,000 seats, which was approved by finance and the board in the Philanthropy Policy . Each organization will be eligible for up to 20 seats. This will allow us to assist as many organizations as possible. This will be revisited throughout the year and adjusted as needed. Interested organizations who are new customers may request additional seats although the request may not be granted. To limit churn, current GitLab customers that apply to transition to the Nonprofit Program will not be granted a special request above the 20 seats. What are the terms of the GitLab for Nonprofits program? Upon acceptance, program members are subject to the GitLab Subscription Agreement . The decision to issue a GitLab for Nonprofits license is always at the sole discretion of GitLab. Interested organizations need to visit the GitLab for Nonprofits page and submit the application form . How are applications processed? Nonprofits apply on the GitLab for Nonprofits page. Once the application is submitted, the Nonprofit will receive a message and a link to TechSoup, our verification partner. The Nonprofit will then need to log in or create their TechSoup account. TechSoup provides a rigorous vetting process to ensure the nonprofit is eligible for the GitLab for Nonprofits program and meets all requirements. If a Nonprofit is verified, TechSoup will notify GitLab. GitLab will then undergo its own vetting and approval process. Once all parties have verified and approved the Nonprofit, GitLab will send the instructions directly to the Nonprofit to redeem their license. If a Nonprofit is not verified through TechSoup, TechSoup will provide details on how the Nonprofit can become verified. If a Nonprofit is declined from GitLab, GitLab will notify the Nonprofit via nonprofits@GitLab.com . Please allow up to 15 business days for the application and verification process. Must Nonprofits renew their memberships? Yes. All nonprofits must renew their membership annually, which involves a re-verification process. Nonprofits will submit for renewal the same way they first applied for the program. Where can members receive support? While GitLab for Nonprofits Program benefits do not include product support , program members can receive help with GitLab in a number of ways. In general, we recommend the following: I’m a GitLab Team Member and I have a customer applying for the program. What do I do?

We provide support and guidance to uphold consistent business processes around the protection of personal data as it relates to GitLab customers, users, Team Members, and other natural persons. We collaborate cross-functionally and serve as advocates to ensure that the data privacy practices of GitLab meet the needs of our cross-functional partners and are continually balanced with an ever-changing global data privacy and protection landscape. Slack channel - #legal is the best place for questions relating to our team that do not require legal advice, deliverables, or any discussion of confidential information. For issues that require action from the Privacy Team, apply the label Privacy::Intake . This will update the Privacy Legal Issue Board and allow the team to triage the issue appropriately. We also use the following labels: For sensitive, private, or confidential requests email legal_internal@gitlab.com . Please do not send emails to this address for engineering, marketing, sales or procurement requests. These should be directed to #legal or an issue should be created in the Legal and Compliance project. Tell people what you are doing with personal data and why you are doing it so that the person can make an informed decision about whether they want to allow it to happen. Do not be creepy about what personal data is collected or how it is used and do not change the way personal data is used without first giving people notice and an opportunity to object, or, where required, obtaining prior consent. Make it easy for people to tell us their privacy preferences and honor those preferences even if they change over time. Build a product or service that has privacy-focused settings turned on by default and let the consumer decide if and when they want to change that. Transparency is a core value and every team member is responsible for the proper collection and use of personal data consistent with our Privacy Statement . Anonymization The process of permanently and irreversibly altering personal data in a way that it is no longer capable of being related back to a specific individual. Consent A freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of an individual’s wishes. Consent is captured by an un-ticked checkbox or other unequivocal statement which signifies agreement to the processing of personal data before or at the time of collection. Data Classification A method of determining types of data associated by risk. See GitLab Security Data Classification Standards for more information. Data Controller A natural or legal person, agency, or other entity which alone, or jointly with others, determines the purpose and means of processing personal data. For example, GitLab is a Data Controller is in the areas of marketing and sales where the personal data of prospects and leads is managed solely at our discretion. GitLab also serves as a Data Controller for all personal data collected from Team Members for employment purposes and any administration of benefits. Data Processor A natural or legal person, agency, or other entity which processes personal data on behalf of a Data Controller. GitLab acts as a Data Processor when we manage personal data native to a Customer’s instance or namespace. GitLab acts as a Processor in these situations because the Customer is the ultimate owner of the data it submits to the service offerings, and our contracts service as Customer’s instructions to GitLab regarding the processing of their data. Data Subject An identified or identifiable natural person. Data Subject Rights Rights granted to individuals in relation to personal data or information processed about them. Because Data Subjct Rights are instrumental to the privacy and protection of data subjects, many of these rights are codified under global privacy legislation, such as the GDPR, CCPA, and LGDP. If a business processes personal data pursuant to certain bases such as consent or legitimate interest, then a data subject may assert one of its fundamental rights and a business is obligated to respond under law. The rights granted vary slightly by country, region, province or state. GitLab treats all users and Team Members the same and will respond to a data subject request from any individual user or team member even if they live in a country, region, or state/province without specific data protection laws. Expand the following section for more information about the data subject rights available. Right of Access A request seeking access to the specific pieces of personal data that have been collected and used by a Data Controller. Right to Correct A request asking for inaccurate or incomplete personal data to be corrected. Right to Delete A request which seeks the erasure of personal data relating to the data subject. Deletion requests must meet certain conditions and businesses are not required to delete any personal data that is processed to meet legal obligations, including that data which may be processed in pursuit or in defense of claims. Right to Portability A request where the data subject wants to transfer their data to another Data Controller; typically seen when the individual changes service providers that share a compatible electronic filing system. Right to Restrict Processing This is a request for the Data Controller to stop processing personal data under certain circumstances. This may also include a request to limit the use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Data. Right to Object A request to opt-out of all data processing or specific processing of personal data based on consent or legitimate interest. Generally this is a request to opt-out of processing for targeted advertising, which includes the sale or sharing of personal data for profiling or cross-context behavioral advertising. Right Not to be Subject to Fully Automated Decisions This is a request that the data subject not be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which would have a significant legal impact. An example might be an algorithm that excludes someone of a certain race from obtaining a credit card. DPIA A Data Protection Impact Assessment is a method to review and document identified privacy compliance risks, as well as evalute higher risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals, including any that pose potential for significant harm. Learn more about GitLab’s process for completing DPIAs here . Personal Data Any data, individually or when combined with other data, that identifies, relates to, describes or is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an identifiable natural person (a ‘data subject’), whether directly or indirectly. See also, Sensitive Personal Data. Privacy by Default A concept that should be implemented at the product development stage and uses appropriate measures to ensure that, by default, the only personal data processed is what is truly necessary. In practice, this means a user’s privacy settings prioritize privacy in their default state. Privacy by Design A concept which focuses on intentionally designing a product that incorporates foundational privacy principles and ensures that Controllers and Processors are able to fulfill data protection obligations. This may include appropriate technical and organizational measures such as pseudonymisation and encryption. Pseudonymization The process of altering personal data so that it can no longer be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional re-identifying information. In order to practice successful Pseudonymization, the re-identifying information should be kept separate from the pseudonymized data. Publicly Available Personal Data Refers to personal data that is publicly available from federal, state, or local government records or made manifestly public by the data subject. Under limited data privacy laws this may also include personal data made public through widely distributed media. Sensitive Personal Data Data that is particularly personal and intimately tied to the core identity of a person. This type of data generally includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data related to health, data related to sex life or sexual orientation, criminal offenses, and citizenship/immigraion status. In some jurisdictions, Sensitive Personal Data includes government identifiers and financial data. Every vendor that handles personal data is required to go through a Privacy Review prior to being onboarded, which includes completion and approval of the privacy due diligence questionnaires detailed in the Procurement process . Certain vendors who are classified as handling red or orange data under our Data Classification Standards are reviewed annually. Additionally, when new product features are designed, there are times when a formal privacy review is required. This section outlines the process for these reviews. For Third-Party Risk Acceptance, any Moderate/High risk requires VP and/or above approval Anytime a new feature or a change to an existing feature is planned, Product Managers and Engineering Managers should evaluate if the planned development presents a legal risk where personal data is involved. If Personal Data is implicated, utilize the Legal Risk Checklist and Workflow ( internal only ) GitLab Team Members are required to complete annual training which covers general privacy practices worldwide. The goal of annual training is to ensure that Team Members understand what personal data is and how to handle it to ensure that GitLab maintains the trust our customers have placed in us as well as to ensure that GitLab remains compliant with frequently changing legal and regulatory obligations."

    "paragraph": "The guidance for using open source software has been updated to enable team members to comprehensively determine which open source license types are pre-approved (deemed acceptable) for use, and which require prior review by the Legal & Corporate Affairs team (as their use may be unacceptable). Team members wishing to use open source software should now refer to the comprehensive Blue Oak Council license list, and proceed, as follows: Team members must ensure that we comply with all requirements and restrictions associated with the applicable license (these are typically defined in the body text of the license). If you’re contributing to an open source project on behalf of GitLab, you may be required to enter into a CLA. In accordance with the Authorization Matrix Policy , legal approval is required to you enter into a CLA on behalf of GitLab. If you have the choice between a Corporate and Individual CLAs, opt for the Corporate CLA. Follow these steps to obtain legal approval and enter into a CLA on behalf of GitLab: Contributions to a third-party project on behalf of GitLab should be made using your @gitlab.com email address. Post any questions to the #legal Slack channel. Alternatively, if looking for information on contributing to GitLab see here . GitLab has established guidance to aid with determining authorship of academic papers developed at GitLab. This guidance is accessible to team members only here The purpose behind this initiative is to ensure consistent and fair licensing enforcement for breaches of certain licensing terms, in order to support the continued growth of the open source community. Further information on this initiative is available here . GitLab’s GPL Cooperation Commitment follows: Before filing or continuing to prosecute any legal proceeding or claim (other than a Defensive Action) arising from termination of a Covered License, GitLab commits to extend to the person or entity (“you”) accused of violating the Covered License the following provisions regarding cure and reinstatement, taken from GPL version 3. As used here, the term ’this License’ refers to the specific Covered License being enforced. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. GitLab intends this Commitment to be irrevocable, and binding and enforceable against GitLab and assignees of or successors to GitLab’s copyrights. GitLab may modify this Commitment by publishing a new edition on this page or a successor location. ‘Covered License’ means the GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPLv2), the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 (LGPLv2.1), or the GNU Library General Public License, version 2 (LGPLv2), all as published by the Free Software Foundation. ‘Defensive Action’ means a legal proceeding or claim that GitLab brings against you in response to a prior proceeding or claim initiated by you or your affiliate. GitLab means GitLab Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries."

    "title": "Risk Management and Dispute Resolution (RMDR)",
    "paragraph": "The Risk Management and Dispute Resolution (RMDR) division of GitLab Legal and Corporate Affairs (LACA) is responsible for informing and guiding GitLab’s risk management strategies as well as managing internal and external investigations, litigation and other dispute resolution. We seek to support resolution across a wide range of topics, including responding to subpoenas and discovery requests, drafting and revising legal documentation, managing investigations and negotiating and drafting agreements. It is our goal to proactively address and resolve these matters in support of GitLab’s business objectives, coordinating with internal business partners across the company whenever appropriate. In support of these goals, we adopt this mantra: if you see something, say something! There are times when GitLab team members must immediately consult with RMDR to ensure that GitLab is managing its legal risks effectively. These include: If in doubt, please involve RMDR earlier rather than later – we would always rather be proactive than reactive. You can reach out to RMDR via rmdr@gitlab.com . Privileged communication is communication, written or oral, that is protected from later disclosure in litigation because it was conveyed to the attorney in confidence by a client for the purpose of seeking legal advice or by an attorney for the purpose of giving legal advice . Privilege can also be asserted over certain confidential documents created by attorneys for the same purpose. The terminology differs depending on the jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, the privilege is generally referred to as “attorney-client privilege” for communications made to or from an attorney for the purpose of providing legal advice or “attorney work product” for communication or documentations created in relation to actual or anticipated litigation. In many of our EMEA and APAC countries, it may be called “client legal privilege,” “legal professional privilege,” “legal advice privilege,” or “litigation privilege.” Additionally, the scope of the privilege differs by country. It is therefore likely that the status of a privileged communication that contains legal advice in respect of foreign law will be determined by reference to the law of the country in which any action is taken. If you have jurisdiction-specific questions about privilege, please contact a LACA team member who sits in that jurisdiction. Practically speaking, this means that communications between our team members and members of LACA are not necessarily privileged just because a member of the LACA team is involved. As a threshold matter, the LACA team consists of both attorneys and non-attorneys. Communications may be privileged if the person wishing to assert the privilege can establish that the communication was made to an attorney of the LACA team and the dominant purpose of the communication was to seek legal advice. Conversely, if the dominant purpose of the communication - even if made to an attorney - is simply to seek business advice, it is very unlikely to be privileged. Additionally, otherwise privileged communication will lose its privilege in most circumstances if it is further or also disclosed to third parties. Thus, team members should always be aware of who has access to the communication and should be very careful about forwarding it. What are some tips for team members to follow to help maintain privileged communication? Below are the steps you can take to help ensure that any communications you have with GitLab’s LACA team can be considered privileged: For more information, please see the internal handbook here . A legal hold is the process GitLab uses to preserve all forms of relevant evidence, whether it be emails, instant messages, physical documents, handwritten or typed notes, voicemails, raw data, backup tapes, and any other type of information that could be relevant to an investigation, pending or imminent litigation or when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Legal holds are imperative in preventing spoliation (destruction, deletion, or alteration) of evidence which can have a severely negative impact on a company’s case, including leading to sanctions. Once GitLab becomes aware of an investigation or potential litigation, a GitLab attorney will provide notice to the impacted team members, instructing them not to delete or destroy any information relating to the subject matter of the investigation or potential litigation. The legal hold applies to paper and electronic documents. During a legal hold, all retention policies must be overridden. Your obligation to follow the procedures outlined in the notice continues until the hold is lifted, even if you depart the Company. If you depart the Company, all Company owned devices and any material you are holding in accordance with any active Legal Hold Notice or active Company investigation should be turned over upon your departure."

    "title": "Trade Compliance",
    "paragraph": "Trade control laws, which often consist of sanctions, export controls, and import laws, govern how and under what circumstances technology, software, and technical assistance may be exported. Trade control laws vary from country to country but usually exist to protect national security and further foreign policy and economic interests. Under United States law, exports, re-exports, and transfers, can take many forms, including oral, written, and visual disclosure, physical shipment, and electronic transfer or transmission. An export can also occur when technology, software, or technical assistance is transmitted to U.S. nationals abroad, or to non-U.S. nationals located within the United States. The export of certain software, technology, or technical assistance to certain countries, certain end users, or for certain end uses, may require authorization from the United States government prior to export, re-export, or transfer. GitLab Enterprise Edition, related technology, and services (collectively, “GitLab Software”), are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), and various sanctions programs administered by the U.S Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The GitLab Community Edition is freely available to the public and is not subject to the EAR. GitLab continuosly monitors developments to these regulations to maintain compliance and to leverage any opportunity to broaden access to GitLab in a compliant manner that allows everyone to contribute. The GitLab Software has been classified via CCATS G178430 as a 5D992.c mass market encryption product with eligibility for export to most destinations under 15 CFR 740.17(b)(1) of license exception ENC. GitLab users may not export, re-export, or transfer GitLab Software, without first obtaining authorization from the U.S. government, to (a) any U.S. embargoed country including but not limited to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, Belarus, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, (b) any party identified on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person list or the Department of Commerce Denied Persons, Entity, or Unverified lists, or (c) for end use involving sensitive nuclear, rocket systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, missiles, chemical or biological weapons, or for any other end use prohibited by 15 CFR 744. GitLab provides this information, which is subject to change without notice, to facilitate GitLab users’ compliance with applicable trade control law. GitLab users remain solely responsible for exporting, re-exporting, and transferring GitLab Software and any user-developed content in accordance with those regulations and should seek legal counsel as necessary."
